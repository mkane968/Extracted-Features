              "'paratext we are entirely surrounded by vugs  to pete garden this cryptic message penciled on the back of a matchbook in his own handwriting was frighteningly clear hed wanted to talk to carol about it but he wasnt sure she was his eighteenth wife after all and hed known her only two days this wasnt the usual case of hostile feelings towards the titanian observers of earth the vugs after all relations between the two planets were now peaceful enough or were they nothing was as it should be no one was quite what he seemed but pete knew that someone was playing a deadly game with the gameplaying people of earth and the stakes were the highest life or death philip k dick is one of the more unusual talents among sciencefiction writers anthony boucher characterized his work as showing a fertile speculative mind    plus the chilling symbolism of absolute nightmare recognition of his talents came with the award to mr dick of the world science fiction conventions 1963 hugo for a novellength book a resident of northern california he divides his time between his writing and his enthusiasm for recorded music his short stories have appeared in all the leading magazines and a collection of the best of these has appeared in an ace books volume the variable man d261 novels in ace books editions include the following solar lottery d340 the cosmic puppets d249 eye in the sky d211 dr futurity d421 vulcans hammer d457 start of book chapter 1 it had been a bad night and when he tried to drive home he had a terrible argument with his car mr garden you are in no condition to drive please use the autoauto mech and recline in the rear seat pete garden sat at the steering tiller and said as distinctly as he could manage look i can drive one drink in fact several make you more alert so stop fooling around he punched the starter button but nothing happened start dam it the autoauto said you have not inserted the key okay he said feeling humiliated maybe the car was right resignedly he inserted the key the engine started up but the controls were still dead the rushmore effect was still taking place inside the hood he knew it was a losing argument all right ill let you drive he said with as much dignity as possible since youre so eager youll probably louse it all up anyhow like you always do when imnot feeling well he crawled into the back seat threw himself down as the car lifted from the pavement and skimmed through the night sky its signal lights blinking god he felt bad his head was killing him his thoughts turned as always back to the game why had it gone so badly silvanus angst was responsible that clown his brotherinlaw or rather former brotherin law thats right pete said to himself i have to remember im not married to freya any more freya and i lost and so our marriage was dissolved and were starting over again with freya married to clem gaines and im not married to anybody yet because i havent managed to roll a three yet ill roll a three tomorrow he told himself and when i do theyll have to import a wife for me ive used them all up in the group his car hummed on finding its way above the deserted midsection of california the desolate lands of abandoned towns did you know that he asked his car that ive been married to every woman in the group now and i havent had any luck yet so it must be me right the car said its you even if it were me it wouldnt be my fault its the red chinese i hate them he lay supine staring up at the stars through the transparent dome of the car i love you though ive had you for years youre never going to wear out he felt tears rise up in his eyes is that right it depends on the preventative maintenance you faithfully follow i wonder what kind of woman theyll import for me i wonder the car echoed what other group was his grouppretty blue foxin closest contact with probably straw man special which met in las vegas and represented bindmen from nevada utah and idaho shutting his eyes he tried to remember what the women of straw man special looked like when i get home to my apartment in berkeley pete said to himself illand then he remembered something dreadful he could not go home to berkeley because he had lost berkeley in the game tonight walt remington had won it from him by calling his bluff on square thirtysix that was what had made it such a bad night change course he said hoarsely to the autoauto circuit he still held title deed to most of marin county he could stay there well go to san rafael he said sitting up and rubbing his forehead groggily a male voice said mrs gaines freya combing her short blonde hair before the mirror did not look around absorbed she thought it sounds like that awful bill calumine do you want a ride home the voice asked and then freya realized that it was her new husband clem gaines you are going home arent you clem gaines large and overstuffed with blue eyes she thought like broken glass that had been glued there and glued slightly awry strolled across the game room toward her it pleased him obviously to be married to her it wont be for long freya thought unless she thought suddenly we have luck she continued brushing her hair paying no attention to him for a woman one hundred and forty years old she decided critically i look all right but i cant take responsibility for it   none of us can they were preserved all of them by the absence of something rather than the presence in each of them the hynes gland had been removed at maturity and so for them the aging process was now imperceptible i like you freya clem said youre a refreshing person you make it obvious you dont like me he did not seem bothered oafs like clem gaines never were lets go somewhere freya and find out right away if luckwise you and i he broke off because a vug had come into the room jean blau putting on her coat groaned look it wants to be friendly they always do she backed away from it her husband jack blau looked about for the groups vugstick ill poke it a couple of times and itll go away he said no freya protested its not doing any harm shes right silvanus angst said he was at the sideboard preparing himself a last drink just pour a little salt on it he giggled the vug seemed to have singled out clem gaines it likes you freya thought maybe you can go somewhere with it  instead of me but that was not fair to clem because none of them con sorted with their former adversaries it was just not done despite the efforts by the titanians to heal the old rift of wartime dislike they were a siliconbased life form rather than carbonbased their cycle was slow and involved methane rather than oxygen as the metabolic catalyst and they were bisexual    which was a rather nonb system indeed poke it bill calumine said to jack blau with the vugstick jack prodded the jellylike cytoplasm of the vug go home he told it sharply he grinned at bill calumine maybe we can have some fun with it lets try to draw it into conversation hey vuggy you like make talktalk at once eagerly the titanians thoughts came to them addressed to all the humans in the condominium apartment any pregnancies reported if so our medical facilities are available and we urge you to listen vuggy bill calumine said if we have any luck well keep it to ourselves its bad luck to tell you everybody knows that how come you dont know that it knows it silvanus angst said it just doesnt like to think about it well its time the vugs faced reality jack blau said we dont like them and thats it come on he said to his wife lets go home impatiently he waved jean toward him the various members of the group filed out of the room and down the front steps of the building to their parked cars freya found herself left with the vug there have been no pregnancies in our group she told the vug answering its question tragic the vug thought back in response but there will be freya said i know well have luck soon why is your particular group so hostile to us the vug asked freya said why we hold you responsible for our sterility you know that especially our spinner bill calumine does she thought but it was your military weapon the vug protested no not ours the red chinese the vug did not grasp the distinction in any case we are doing all we can to i dont want to discuss it freya said please let us help the vug begged she said to it go to hell and left the apartment striding down the stairs to the street and her car the cold dark night air of carmel california revived her she took a deep breath glanced up at the stars smelled the freshness the clean new scents to her car she said open the door i want to get in yes mrs garden the car door swung open im not mrs garden any more im mrs gaines she entered seated herself at the manual tiller try to keep it straight yes mrs gaines as soon as she put the key in the motor started up has pete garden already left she scanned the gloomy street and did not see petes car i guess he has she felt sad it would have been nice to sit out here under the stars so late at night and chat a little it would be as if they were still married    damn the game she thought and its spins damn luck itself bad luck thats all we seem to have any more were a marked race she held her wrist watch to her ear and it said in its tiny voice twofifteen am mrs garden mrs gaines she grated twofifteen am mrs gaines how many people she wondered are alive on the face of earth at this moment one million two million how many groups playing the game surely no more than a few hundred thousand and every time there was a fatal accident the population decreased irretrievably by one more automatically she reached into the glove compartment of the car and groped for a neatlywrapped strip of rabbitpaper as it was called she found a stripit was the old kind not the newand unwrapped it put it between her teeth and bit in the glare of the dome light of the car she examined the strip of rabbitpaper one dead rabbit she thought recalling the old days they were before her time when a rabbit had to die for this fact in question to be determined the strip in the dome light was white not green she was not pregnant crumpling the strip she dropped it into the disposal chute of the car and it incinerated instantly damn she thought wretchedly well what did i expect the car left the ground started for her home in los angeles too early though to tell about my luck with clem she realized obviously that cheered her another week or two and perhaps something poor pete she thought hasnt even rolled a three isnt back in the game really should i drop by his bind in marin county see if hes there but he was so stewed so unmanageable so bitterly unpleasant tonight there is no law or rule though that prevents us meeting outside the game and yetwhat purpose would it serve we had no luck she realized pete and i in spite of our feeling for each other the radio of her car came on suddenly she heard the callletters of a group in ontario canada broadcasting on all frequencies in great excitement this is pear book hovel the man declared exultantly tonight at ten pm our time we had luck a woman in our group mrs don palmer bit her rabbitpaper with no more idea of hoping than she ever did and frey a shut off the radio when he got home to his unlit unused former apartment in san rafael pete garden went at once to the medicine cabinet in the bathroom to see what medication he could find ill never get to sleep otherwise he knew it was an old story with him snoozex it now took three 25mg tablets of snoozex to have any effect on him he had taken too many for too long i need something stronger he thought theres always phenobarbital but it slugs you for the next day scopolamine hydrobromide i could try that or he thought i could try something much stronger emphytal three of those he thought and id never wake up not in the strength capsules ive got here  he let the capsules lie on his palm as he stood considering no one would bother me no one would intervene the medicine cabinet said mr garden i am establishing contact with dr macy in salt lake city because of your condition i have no condition pete said he quickly put the emphytal capsules back in their bottle see he waited it was just momentary a gesture here he was pleading with the rushmore effect of his medicine cabinetmacabre okay he asked it hopefully a click the cabinet had shut itself off pete sighed in relief the doorbell sounded what now he wondered walking through the faintly mustysmelling apartment his mind still on what he could take as a soporificwithout activating the alarmcircuit of the rushmore effect he opened the door there stood his blondehaired previous wife freya hi she said coolly she walked into the apartment gliding past him selfpossessed as if it were perfectly natural for her to seek him out while she was married to clem gaines what do you have in your fist she asked seven snoozex tablets he admitted ill give you something better than that its going the rounds freya dug into her leather mailbagstyle purse a new new product manufactured in new jersey by an autofac pharmaceutical house there she held out a large blue spansule nerduwel she said and then laughed haha pete said not amused it was a gag neerdowell is that what you came for having been his wife his bluff partner for over three months she of course knew of his chronic insomnia ive got a hangover he informed her and i lost berkeley to walt remington tonight as you well know so im just not capable of banter right now then fix me some coffee freya said she removed her furlined jacket and laid it over a chair or let me fix it for you with sympathy she said you do look bad berkeleywhy did i put the title deed up anyhow iv dont even remember of all my holdingsit must have been a selfdestructive impulse he was silent and then he said on the way here tonight i picked up an allpoints from ontario i heard it she said nodding does their pregnancy elate or depress you i dont know freya said somberly im glad for them but she roamed about the apartment her arms folded it depresses me pete said he put a tea kettle of water on the range in the kitchen thank you the tea kettleits rushmore effectpiped freya said we could have a relationship outside of the game you realize it has been done it wouldnt be fair to clem he felt a camaraderie with clem gaines it overcame his feelingstemporarily anyhowfor her and in any case he was curious about his future wife sooner or later he would roll a three chapter 2 pete garden was awakened the next morning by a sound so wonderfully impossible that he jumped from the bed and stood rigid listening he heard children they were quarreling somewhere outside the window of his san rafael apartment it was a boy and a girl and pete thought so there have been births in this county since i was last here and of par ents who are nonb not bindmen without property which would enable them to play the game he could hardly believe it and he thought i ought to deed the parents a small town    san anselmo or ross even both they deserve an opportunity to play but maybe they dont want to youre one the girl was declaring angrily youre another the boys voice laden with accusation gimme that sounds of a physical scuffle he lit a cigarette then found his clothes and began to dress in the corner of the room leaning against the wall a mv3 rifle  he caught sight of it and paused remembering in a rush everything that the great old weapon had meant once he had been prepared to stand off the red chinese with this rifle but it had never seen use because the red chinese had never shown up  at least not in person their representatives in the form of hinkel radiation had arrived however but no amount of mv3s doled out to californias citizen army could fight and conquer that the radiation from a waspc satellite had done the job expected and the united states had lost but peoples china had not won no one had hinkel radiation waves distributed on a worldwide basis saw to that god bless em going over pete picked up the mv3 and held it as he had long ago in his youth this gun he realized is one hundred and thirty years old almost an antique twice over would it still fire who cared    there was no one to kill with it now only a psychotic could find grounds to kill in the nearlyempty cities of earth and even a psychotic might think it over and change his mind after all with fewer than ten thousand people in all california  he set the gun back down carefully anyhow the gun had not been primarily an antipersonnel weapon its tiny acartridges had been intended to penetrate the armor plating of soviet tl90 tanks and cripple them remembering the training films they had been shown by sixth army brass pete thought id like to catch sight of a human sea these days chinese or not    we could use it i salute you bernhardt hinkel he thought caustically the humane inventor of the ultimate in painless weapons    no it hadnt hurt you were correct we felt nothing didnt even know and then removal of the hynes gland in as many people as possible had been instigated and it hadnt been a waste of effort because of it there were people alive today and certain combinations of male and female were not sterile it was not an absolute condition but rather a relative one we can in theory have children in fact a few of us do the children outside his window for instance    along the street a homeostatic maintenance vehicle swished collecting trash and checking on the growth of lawns first on one side of the street and then on the other the steady whirring of the machine rose above the childrens voices the empty city is kept tidy pete said to himself as the machine halted to send out pseudopodia to grope peevishly at a camellia bush or rather virtually empty citya dozen or so nonb people lived here at least according to the census he had last been shown behind the maintenance vehicle came a second construct this one even more elaborate like a great twentylegged bug it propelled itself down a driveway hot on the scent of decay the repair vehicle would rebuild whatever had fallen into ruin pete knew it would bind up the wounds of the city halt deterioration before it began and for what for whom good questions perhaps the vugs liked to look down from their observation satellites and see an intact civilization rather than mere ruins putting out his cigarette pete went into the kitchen hoping to find food for breakfast he had not inhabited this apartment for several years but nonetheless he opened the vacuumsealed refrigerator and found in it bacon and milk and eggs bread and jam all in good shape everything he needed for breakfast antonio nardi had been bindman in residence here before pete undoubtedly he had left these not knowing that he was going to lose his title in the game would never be coming back but there was something more important than breakfast something pete had to do first clicking on the vidphone he said id like walter remington in contra costa county yes mr garden the vidphone said and the screen after a pause lit up hi walt remingtons dour elongated features appeared and he gazed dully at pete walt had not shaved yet this morning stubble coated his jowls and his eyes small and redrimmed were puffy from lack of sleep why so early he mumbled he was still in his pajamas pete said do you remember what happened last night oh yeah sure walt nodded smoothing his disordered hair in place i lost berkeley to you i dont know why i put it up its been my bind my residence you know i know walt said taking a deep breath pete said ill trade you three cities in marin county for it ross san rafael and san anselmo i want it back i want to live there walt pointed out you can live in berkeley as a nonb resident of course not as bindman i cant live like that pete said i want to own it not just be a squatter come on walt you dont intend to live in berkeley i know you its too cold and foggy for you you like the hot valley climate like sacramento where you are now in walnut creek thats true walt said buti cant trade berkeley back to you pete the admission was dragged out of him then i dont have it when i got home last night a broker was waiting for me dont ask me how he knew id acquired it from you but he did a big wheeler and dealer from the east matt pendleton associates walt looked glum and you sold berkeley to them pete could hardly believe it it meant that someone who was not part of thengroup had managed to buy into california whyd you do it he demanded they traded me salt lake city for it walt said with morose pride how could i turn that down now i can join colonel kitcheners group they play in provo utah sorry pete he looked guilty i was still a little stewed i guess anyhow it sounded too good to turn down at the time pete said whod pendleton associates acquire it for they didnt say and you didnt ask no walt admitted morosely i didnt i guess i should have pete said i want berkeley back im going to track the deed down and get it back even if i have to trade off all of marin county and in the meantime ill be looking forward to beating you at gametime look for me to take away everything youve gotno matter who your partner is savagely he clicked off the vidphone the screen became dark how could walt do it he asked himself turn the title right over to someone outside the groupsomeone from the east ive got to know who pendleton associates would be representing in a deal like that he said to himself he had a feeling acute and ominous that he knew chapter 3 it was a very good morning for mr jerome luckman of new york city becauseand it flashed into his mind the moment he awoketoday was the first time in his life that he owned berkeley california operating through matt pendleton associates he had at last been able to obtain a choice piece of california real estate and this meant that now he could sit in on the gameplaying of pretty blue fox which met at carmel each night and carmel was almost as nice a town as berkeley sid he called come into my office luckman sat back in his chair puffed on his afterbreakfast delicado mexican cigarette his secretary nonbindman sid mosk opened the office door and put his head in yes mr luckman bring me that precog luckman said ive finally got a use for him a use he thought which justifies the risk of disbarment from the game whats his name dave mutreaux or something luckman had a hazy memory of interviewing the precog but a man of his position saw so many people every day and after all new york city was wellpopulated almost fifteen thousand souls and many were children hence new make sure he comes up a back way luckman said i dont want anybody to see him he had his reputation to maintain and this was a touchy situation it was illegal of course to bring a person with psionic talents to the game because psi in terms of gameplaying represented a form of cheating pure and simple for years eegs electroencephalograms had been given customarily by many groups but this practice had died out at least luckman hoped so certainly it was done no longer in the east because all the psipeople were known and the east set the style for the whole country did it not one of luckmans cats a gray and white shorthaired tom hopped onto his desk he absently scratched the cats chin thinking to himself if i cant work that precog into the pretty blue fox group i think ill go myself true he hadnt played the game in a year or more    but he had been the best player around how else could he have become the bindman for greater new york city and there had been strong competition in those days competition which luckman had rendered nonb singlehandedly theres no one that can beat me at bluff luckman said to himself and everybody knows that still with a precog    it was a sure thing and he liked the idea of a sure thing because although he was an expert bluff player he did not like to gamble he had not played because he enjoyed it he had played to win he had for instance run the great gameplayer joe schilling right out of existence now joe operated a little old phonograph record shop in new mexico his gameplaying days were over remember how i beat joe schilling he said to sid that last play its still in my mind every detail joe rolled a five with the dice and drew a card from the fifth deck he looked at it a long time much too long i knew then that he was going to bluff finally he moved his piece eight squares ahead that put him on a topwin square you know that one about inheriting one hundred and fifty thousand dollars from a dead uncle that piece of his sat on that square and i looked at it he had perhaps a little psionic talent of his own because it had seemed to him that actually he could read joe schillings mind you drew a six he had felt with absolute conviction your move eight squares ahead is a bluff aloud he said that called schillings bluff at that time joe had been new york city bindman and could beat anyone at the game it was rare for any player to call one of joes moves raising his great shaggy bearded head joe schilling had eyed him there was silence all the players waited you really want to see the card i drew joe schilling asked yes he waited unable to breathe his lungs ached if he were wrong if the card really were an eight then joe schilling had won again and his grip on new york city was even more secure joe schilling said quietly it was a six he flipped over the card luckman had been right it had been a bluff and the title deed to greater new york city was his the cat on luckmans desk yawped now hoping for breakfast luckman pushed it away and it hopped to the floor parasite luckman said to it but he felt fond of the cat he believed devoutly that cats were lucky he had had two toms with him in the condominium apartment that night when he had beaten joe schilling perhaps they had done it rather than a latent psionic talent i have dave mutreaux on the vid his secretary said hes standing by do you want to speak to him personally if hes a genuine precog luckman said he already knows what i want so theres no need for me or anyone else to speak to the zwepp the paradoxes of precognition always amused and irked him cut the circuit sid and if he never shows up here it proves hes no good sid obediently cut the circuit the screen died but let me point out sid said you never spoke to him so there never was anything for him to preview isnt that right he can preview the actual interview with me luckman answered here in my office when i give him his instructions i guess thats right sid admitted berkeley luckman said musingly i havent been there in eighty or ninety years like many bindmen he did not like to enter an area which he did not own it was a superstition perhaps but he considered it decidedly bad luck i wonder if its still foggy there well ill soon see from his desk drawer he brought forth the title deed which the broker had delivered to him lets see who was bindman last he said reading the deed walter remington hes the one who won it last night and then right away sold it and before him a fellow named peter garden i wouldnt be surprised if this peter garden is angry as hell right now or will be when he finds out he probably figured on winning it back and hell never win it back now luckman said to himself not from me are you going to fly out there to the coast sid asked right luckman said as soon as i can get packed im going to set up a vacation residence in berkeley assuming i like itassuming it isnt decayed one thing i cant stand is a decayed town i dont mind them empty that you expect but decay he shuddered if there was one thing that was surely bad luck it was a town which had fallen into ruin as many of the towns in the south had in his early days he had been bindman for several towns in north carolina he would never forget the fshnuger experience sid asked can i be honorary bindman while youre gone sure luckman said expansively ill write you out a parchment scroll in gold and seal it with red wax and ribbon really sid said eying him uncertainly luckman laughed youd like that a lot of ceremony like poohbah in the mikado lord high honorary bindman of new york city and tax assessments fixed on the side right flushing sid murmured i notice you worked hard for darn near sixtyfive years to get to be bindman for this area thats because of my social plans to improve the milieu luckman said when i took over the title deed there were only a few hundred people here now look at the population its due to menot directly but because i encouraged nonb people to play the game strictly for the pairing and repairing of mates isnt that a fact sure mr luckman sid said thats a fact and because of that a lot of fertile couples were uncovered that otherwise never would have paired off right yes sid said nodding the way youve got this musical chairs youre practically singlehandedly bringing back the human race and dont forget it luckman said bending he picked up another of his cats this one a black manx female ill take you along he told the cat as he petted her ill take maybe six or seven cats along with me he decided for luck and also although he did not say it for company nobody on the west coast liked him he would not have his people his nonbs to say hello to him every time he ventured forth thinking that he felt sad but he thought after ive lived there a while ill have it built up like new york it wont be an emptiness haunted by the past ghosts he thought of our life the way it was when our population was splitting the seams of this planet spilling over onto luna and even mars populations on the verge of migration and then those stupid jackasses those red chinese had to use that east german invention of that exnazi thathe could not even think the words that described bernhardt hinkel too bad hinkel isnt still alive luckman said to himself id like to have a few minutes alone with him with no one else watching the only good thing you could say about the hinkel radiation was that it had finally reached east germany there was one person who would know whom matt pendleton associates would be fronting for pete garden decided as he left the apartment in san rafael and hurried to his parked car its worth a trip to new mexico to colonel kitcheners town albuquerque anyhow i have to go there to pick up a record two days ago he had received a letter from joe schilling the worlds foremost rare phonograph record dealer a tito schipa disc which pete had asked for had finally been tracked down and was waiting for him good morning mr garden his car said as he unlocked the door with his key hi pete said preoccupied now from the driveway of the apartment house across the street the two children that he had heard earlier emerged to stare at him are you the bindman the girl asked they had made out his insignia the brilliantlycolored armband we never saw you before mr bindman the girl said awed she was pete guessed about eight years old he explained thats because i havent been here to marin county in years walking toward the two of them he said what are your names im kelly the boy said he appeared to be younger than the girl pete thought perhaps six at the most both of them were sweetlooking kids he was glad to have them in his area and my sisters name is jessica and we have an older sister named mary anne who isnt here shes in san francisco in school three children in one family impressed pete said whats your last name mcclain the girl said with pride she said my mother and father are the only people in all california with three children he could believe that id like to meet them he said the girl jessica pointed we live there in that house its funny you dont know my father since youre the bindman it was my father who organized the streetsweeper and maintenance machines he talked to the vugs about it and they agreed to send them in youre not afraid of the vugs are you pete said no both children shook their heads we did fight a war with them he reminded the two children but that was a long time ago the girl said true pete said well i approve of your attitude he wished that he shared it from the house down the street a slender woman appeared walking toward them mom the girl jessica called excitedly look heres the bindman the woman darkhaired attractive wearing slacks and a brightly checkered cotton shirt lithe and youthfullooking approached welcome to marin county she said to pete we dont see much of you mr garden she held out her hand and they shook i congratulate you pete said for having three children mrs mcclain smiled as they say its luck not skill how about a cup of coffee before you leave marin county after all you may never be back again ill be back pete said indeed the woman did not seem convinced her handsome smile was tinged with irony you know youre almost a legend to us nonbs in this area mr garden gosh well be able to liven conversations for weeks to come telling about our meeting you for the life of him pete could not tell if mrs mcclain was being sardonic despite her words her tone was neutral she baffled him and he felt confused i really will be back he said ive lost berkeley where i oh mrs mcclain said nodding her effective commanding smile increased i see bad luck at the game thats why youre visiting us im on my way to new mexico pete said and got into his car possibly ill see you later on he closed the car door take off he instructed the autoauto as the car rose the two children waved mrs mcclain did not why such animosity pete wondered or had he only imagined it perhaps she resented the existence of the two separate groups b and nonb perhaps she felt it was unfair that so few people had a chance at the gameboard i wouldnt blame her pete realized but she doesnt understand that any moment any one of us can suddenly become nonb we have only to recall joe schilling    once the greatest bindman in the western world and now nonb probably for the rest of his life the division is not as fixed as all that after all he himself had been nonb once he had obtained title to real estate the only way legally possible he had posted his name and then waited for a bindman somewhere to die he had followed the rules set up by the vugs had guessed a particular day month and year and sure enough his guess had been lucky on may 4 2143 a bindman named william rust lawrence had died killed in an auto accident in arizona and pete had become his heir inherited his holdings and entered his gameplaying group the vugs gamblers to the core liked such chancy systems for inheritance and they abhorred cause and effect situations he wondered what mrs mcclains first name was certainly she was pretty he thought he had liked her despite her peculiar bitter attitude liked the way she looked carried herself he wished he knew more about the mcclain family perhaps they had once been bindmen and had been wiped out that would explain it i could ask around he thought after all if they have three children theyre certainly quite well known joe schilling hears everything i can ask him chapter 4 sure joseph schilling said leading the way through the dusty utter disorder of his record shop to the living quarters behind i know patricia mcclain howd you happen to run into her he turned questioningly pete said the mcclains are living in my bind he managed to thread a passage among the piles of records packing cartons letters catalogues and posters from the past how do you ever find anything in this place he asked joe schilling i have a system schilling said vaguely ill tell you why pat mcclains so bitter she used to be a b but she was barred from the game why pats a telepath joe schilling cleared a place at the table in the kitchen and set out two handleless teacups ooh long tea he asked ah so pete said nodding ive got your don pasquale record schilling said as he poured tea from a black ceramic pot the schipa aria dadum dada da a beautiful piece humming he produced lemon and sugar from the cupboard over the dishfilled sink then in a low voice he said look ive got a customer out front he winked at pete and pointed peering past the dusty stained curtain which separated the living quarters from the store pete saw a tall skinny youth with hornrimmed glasses and shaved head the youth was examining a tattered ancient record catalogue a nut schilling said softly eats yogurt and practices yoga and lots of vitamin efor potency i get all kinds the youth called in a stammering voice say do you hhave any claudia muzio records mr schschilling just the letter scene from traviata schilling said making no move to rise from the table pete said i found mrs mcclain physically attractive oh yes very vivacious but not for you shes what jung described as an introverted feeling type they run deep theyre inclined toward idealism and melancholy you need a shallow bright blonde type of woman someone to cheer you up someone to get you out of your suicidal depressions that youre always either falling into or out of schilling sipped his tea a few drops spattering his reddish thick beard well say something or are you in a depression right now no pete said in the front of the store the tall skinny youth called mmr schilling can i listen to this gigli record of una furtiva lagrima sure schilling said he hummed that absently scratching his cheek pete he said you know rumors get to me i hear youve lost berkeley  yes pete admitted and matt pendleton associates that would be lucky jerome luckman schilling said oy vey hes a hard man in the game i ought to know now hell be sitting in with your group and pretty soon hell own all of california cant anybody play against luckman and beat him sure joe schilling nodded i can pete stared at him youre serious but he wiped you out youre a classic case just bad luck schilling said if i had had more title deeds to put up if i had been able to stay in a little longer he smiled a bleak crooked smile bluffs a fascinating game like poker it combines chance and skill equally you can win by either or lose by either i lost by the former on a single bad runactually on a single lucky guess by luckman not skill on his part hell no luckman is to luck as i am to skill we ought to be called luckman and skillman if i ever get a stake and can start again    joe schilling abruptly belched sorry ill stake you pete said suddenly on impulse you cant afford to im expensive because i dont start winning right away it takes time for my skillfactor to over come any chance runs    such as the celebrated one by which luckman wiped me out from the front of the store came the sounds of the superb tenor gigli singing schilling paused a moment to listen across from the table his huge dingy parrot eeore shifted about in its cage annoyed by the sharp pure voice schilling gave the parrot a reproving glance thy tiny hand is frozen schilling said the first of the two recordings gigli made of that and by far the better ever heard the latter of the two from the complete opera and so bad as to be unbelievable wait he silenced himself listening a superb record he said to pete you should have it in your collection i dont care for gigli pete said he sobs a convention schilling said irritably he was an italian its traditional schipa didnt schipa was selftaught schilling said the tall skinny youth had approached carrying the gigli record id llike to buy this mr schilling hhow much one hundred and twentyfive dollars schilling said wow the youth said dismally but nevertheless he got out his wallet very few of these survived the war with the vugs schilling explained as he took the record and began wrapping it in heavy cardboard two more customers entered the shop then a man and woman both of them short squat schilling greeted them good morning les es to pete he said this is mr and mrs sibley like yourself vocal addicts from portland oregon he indicated pete bindman peter garden pete rose and shook hands with les sibley hi mr garden les sibley said in the deferential tone used by a nonb with a b where do you bind sir berkeley pete said and then remembered formerly berkeley now marin county california how do you doo es sibley said in an ultrafawning manner which pete foundand always had foundobjectionable she held out her hand and when he shook it he found it soft and damp ill bet you have a really fine collection i mean ours isnt anything just a few supervia records supervia pete said interested what do you have joe schilling said you cant eliminate me pete its an unwritten agreement that my customers do not trade among themselves if they do i stop selling to them anyhow you have all the supervia records that les and es have and a couple more besides he rang up the hundred and twentyfive dollars from the gigli sale and the tall skinny youth departed what do you consider the finest vocal recording ever made es sibley asked pete aksel schitz singing every valley pete said amen to that les said nodding in agreement after the sibleys had left pete paid for his schipa record had joe schilling wrap it extracarefully and then he took a deep breath and plunged into the issue at hand joe can you win berkeley back for me if joe schilling said yes it was good enough for him after a pause joe schilling said possibly if anybody can i can there is a rulinglittle appliedthat two persons of the same sex can play as bluffpartners we could see if luckman would accept that we might have to put it to the vug commissioner in your area for a ruling that would be a vug which calls itself us cummings pete said he had had a number of squabbles with that particular vug he had found the creature to be particularly trying in a nitpicking manner the alternative joe schilling said thoughtfully would of course be to temporarily deed title to some of your remaining areas to me but as i said before arent you out of practice pete said its been years since you played the game possibly schilling conceded wed soon find out i hope in time i think he glanced toward the front of the store another autoauto had parked outside and a customer was entering it was a lovely redheaded girl and both pete and joe temporarily forgot their conversation the girl evidently at a loss in the chaotic littered store wandered about aimlessly from stack to stack i better go help her joe schilling said do you know her pete asked never saw her before pausing joe schilling straightened his wrinkled oldfashioned necktie smoothed his vest miss he said walking toward the girl and smiling can i assist you perhaps the redheaded girl said in a soft shy voice she seemed selfconscious glancing about her not meeting schillings intent gaze she murmured do you have any records by nats katz good grief no schilling said he turned around and said to pete my days ruined a pretty girl comes in and asks for a nats katz record in chagrin he walked back to pete whos nats katz pete asked the girl roused by amazement from her shyness said youve never heard of nats katz clearly she could not believe it why hes on tv every night hes the greatest recording star of all time pete said mr schilling here does not sell pops mr schilling sells only ancient classics he smiled at the girl it was hard with the hynes gland operation to assess a persons age but it seemed to him that the redheaded girl was quite young perhaps no more than nineteen you should excuse mr schillings reaction pete said to her hes an old man and set in his habits schilling grated come on now i just dont like popular balladbelters everybodys heard of nats the girl said still indignant even my mother and father and theyre distinctly fnool nats last record walkin the dog has sold over five thousand copies youre both really strange people youre real fnools for real now she became shy again i guess i better go so long she started toward the door of the shop wait schilling said in an odd tone starting after her dont i know you havent i seen a newswire picture of you maybe the girl said schilling said youre mary anne mcclain he turned to pete this is the third child of the woman you met today its synchronicity her coming in here you recall jungs and wolfgang paulis theory of the acausal connective principle to the girl schilling said this man is bindman for your area mary anne meet peter garden hi the girl said unimpressed well i have to go she disappeared out the door of the shop and got back into her car pete and joe schilling stood watching until the car took off and was gone how old do you think she is pete said i know how old she is i remember reading it shes eighteen one of twentynine students at san francisco state college majoring in history mary anne was the first child born in san francisco in the past hundred years his tone now was somber god help the world he said if anything happens to her any kind of an accident or illness both of them were silent she reminds me a little of her mother pete said joe schilling said shes stunningly attractive he eyed pete i suppose now youve changed your mind you want to stake her instead of me shes probably never had an opportunity to play the game meaning she wouldnt make a good bluff partner right joe said not nearly as good as me and dont forget that whats your marital status right now when i lost berkeley freya and i split up shes now mrs gaines im looking for a wife but youve got to have one who can play joe schilling said a bindman wife or youll lose marin county just like you lost berkeley and then whatll you do the world cant use two rarerecord shops pete said ive thought over and over again for years what id do if i were wiped out at the table id become a farmer guffawing joe said indeed now you say i was never so serious in all my life  pete said i was never so serious in all my life where  in the sacramento valley id raise grapes for wine ive already looked into it he had in fact discussed it with the vug commissioner us cummings the vug authority would undoubtedly support him with farm equipment and cuttings it was the type of project which they approved of in principle by god schilling said i think you do mean it id charge you extra pete said because youre so rich from gouging record buyers all these years ich bin ein armer mensch schilling protested im poor well possibly we could trade wine for rare records seriously joe schilling said if luckman enters your group and you have to play against him ill come into the game as your partner he slapped pete on the shoulder encouragingly so dont worry between the two of us we can take him of course id expect you not to drink while youre playing he eyed pete keenly i heard about that you were bagged when you put up berkeley and lost it you could hardly reel out of the conapt to your car when it was over with dignity pete stated i drank after i lost for consolation however it may have been my ukase still stands no drinking on your part if we become partners you have to swear off and that includes any pills i dont want your wits dulled by tranquilizers especially the phenothiazine class    i particularly distrust them and i know you take them regularly pete said nothing it was so he shrugged wandered about the store poking at a stack of records here and there he felt discouraged and ill practice joe schilling said ill train sincerely put myself in top shape he poured himself a fresh cup of ooh long tea maybe im going to wind up a lush pete said and with a possible lifespan of two hundred and some years  it could be pretty dreadful i dont think so joe schilling said youre too morose to become an alcoholic im more afraid of he hesitated go ahead and say it pete said  suicide pete slid an ancient hmv record from a stack and examined the label he did not look directly at schilling he avoided meeting the mans wise blunt gaze would you be better off back with freya schilling inquired naw pete gestured i cant explain it because on a rational basis we made a good pair but something intangible didnt work in my opinion thats why she and i lost at the table somehow we never could really pull together as a couple he recalled his wife before freya janice marks now janice remington they had cooperated successfully at least it had seemed so to him but of course they had not had any luck as a matter of fact pete garden had never had any luck in all the world he had no progeny the goddam red chinese he said to himself  he wrote it off with the customary envenomed phrase and yet schilling he said do you have any issue yes schilling said i thought everyone knew a boy eleven years old in florida his mother was my he counted for a time my sixteenth wife i only had two more wives before luckman wiped me out how much issue has luckman exactly ive heard it placed at nine or ten about eleven by now christ pete said we should face the fact joe schilling said that luckman in many ways is the finest most valuable human being alive today the most direct issue the greatest success in bluff his amelioration of the status of the nonbs in his area all right pete said irritably lets drop it and schilling continued unperturbed the vugs like him he added as a matter of fact virtually everyone likes him youve never met him have you no youll see what i mean joe schilling said when he gets out to the west coast and joins pretty blue fox to the precog dave mutreaux luckman said expansively im glad to see you got here it pleased him because it demonstrated the reality of the mans talent it was so to speak a de facto case for using mutreaux the lanky welldressed middleaged psimanhe was in fact a minor bindman in his own right possessing the title to a meager county in western kansasseated himself sprawlingly in the deep chair facing luckmans desk and drawled weve got to be careful mr luckman extremely careful ive been severely limiting myself trying to keep my talent out of sight i can preview what you want me to do fact is i previewed it coming over here by autoauto frankly im surprised that a man of your luck and stature would want to employ me a slow insulting grin crossed the precogs features luckman said im afraid when the players out on the coast see me sitting in they wont want to play theyll band together against me and conspire to keep their really valuable deeds in their safety deposit boxes instead of putting them out on the table you see david they may not know its me who obtained the berkeley deed because i they know mutreaux said still grinning lazily oh the rumours already going around  i heard it on that crooners tv show that nats katz its big news luckman that youve managed to buy into the west coast real big news watch lucky luckmans smoke nats said i recall his words hmm luckman said disconcerted ill tell you something else the precog said he crossed his long legs slouched down in the chair his arms folded i can preview a spread of possible thisevenings some of them with me out there in carmel california sitting in at the game with the pretty blue fox folks and some with you he chuckled and in a couple of the possible thisevenings those folks are sending out for an eeg machine dont ask me why they dont normally keep one handy so it must be a hunch bad luck luckman said grumblingly if i go there and they give me an eeg mutreaux said and find out im psionic you know what that means i lose all the deeds i hold see what im getting at luckman are you prepared to reimburse me if that occurs sure luckman said but he was thinking of something else if an eeg was run on mutreaux the berkeley deed would be forfeited and who would make that up maybe i better go myself and not use mutreaux he said to himself but some primal instinct some nearpsionic hunch inside his mind told him not to go stay away from the west coast it said stay here why should he feel such a powerful acute aversion to venturing forth from new york city was it merely the old superstition that a bindman stayed in his own bind   or was it something more im going to send you anyhow dave luckman said and risk the eeg mutreaux drawled however mr luckman i decline to go i dont care to take the risk myself unwinding his limbs he rose awkwardly to his feet i guess youll just have to go yourself he said with a smile bordering on an outright smirk damn it luckman said to himself these little twobit bindmen are haughty you cant get to them what have you got to lose by going mutreaux asked as far as i can preview pretty blue fox plays with you and it appears from here that your luck holds out i see you winning a second california deed the first night you play he added this forecast i give you free no obligation he touched his forehead in a mock salute thanks luckman snapped thanks for nothing he thought because the biting weak fright was still there in him the prerational aversion to the trip gawd he thought im hooked i paid plenty for berkeley ive got to go anyhow its unreasonable this fear one of his cats an orange tom had ceased washing and was now staring at luckman with its tongue absurdly pro truding ill take you luckman decided you can provide me with your magic protection you and yourwhat was the old beliefyour nine or ten lives put your geschlumer tongue back in he ordered the cat peevishly the cat irritated him it was so ignorant of fate of reality extending his hand dave mutreaux said its good to see you again fellow bindman luckman and maybe i can be of use to you some other time im heading back to kansas now he glanced at his watch its getting late almost time to begin this evenings play luckman said as he shook hands with the precog should i start this soon with pretty blue fox tonight why not seeing the future must give you a hell of a lot of confidence luckman said complainingly it is useful mutreaux agreed i wish i had it on my trip luckman said and then he thought im tired of catering to my superstitions i dont need any psionic power to protect me ive got a lot more than that sid mosk entering the office glanced from luckman to mutreaux and then back at his employer again youre going he said thats right luckman nodded pack my things for me and load them into an autoauto i intend to set up a temporary residence in berkeley before the game begins this evening so ill feel comfortable you know as if i belong will do sid mosk agreed making a note of the request before i go to bed tonight luckman realized ill have sat in with pretty blue fox will have begun almost a new life    i wonder what itll bring once more fervently he wished for dave mutreaux talent chapter 5 in the condominium apartment in carmel which the bluffplaying group of bindmen pretty blue fox owned jointly mrs freya gaines making herself comfortable not sitting too close to her husband clem watched the others arrive one by one bill calumine sauntering aggressively through the open door in his loud sports shirt and tie nodded to her and clem greetings his wife and bluffpartner arlene followed after him a preoccupied frown of worry on her rather wrinkled face arlene had taken advantage of the hynes operation somewhat later in life than had the others hi ya walt remington said gloomily glancing furtively around as he entered with his alert brighteyed wife janice i understand weve got a new member he said in a selfconscious uncomfortable voice guilt was written all over him as he shakily removed his coat and laid it over a chair yes freya said to him and you know why she thought now the sandyhaired baby of the group stuart marks put in his appearance and with him his tall masculine nononsense wife yule wearing a black suede leather jacket and jeans i was listening to nats katz stuart said and he said he was correct clem gaines answered lucky luckman is already on the west coast setting up residence in berkeley carrying a bottle of whiskey wrapped up in a paper bag silvanus angst strolled in smiling broadly at everyone in a good mood as always and immediately after him came swarthy jack blau his dark eyes flickering as he looked at everyone in the room he jerked his head in greeting but did not speak jean his wife greeted freya you might be interested    we looked into the business of getting pete a new wife we were with straw man special for two whole hours today any luck freya asked trying to make her voice sound casual yes jean blau said theres a woman named carol holt coming over from straw man special this evening she should be here any time whats she like freya said preparing herself jean said intelligent i mean freya said what does she look like brown hair small i really cant describe her why dont you just wait jean glanced toward the door and there stood pete garden he had come in and was standing listening hi freya said to him they found you a wife pete said to jean thanks his voice was gruff well you must have a partner to play jean pointed out im not sore pete said like silvanus angst he carried a bottle wrapped up in a paper bag he now set it down on the sideboard next to silvanus and took off his coat in fact im glad he said silvanus giggled and said what petes worried about is the man who got hold of the berkeley deed isnt it pete lucky luckman they say short and plump silvanus waddled over to freya and stroked her hair you worried too carefully disengaging angsts fingers from her hair freya said i certainly am its a terrible thing it is jean blau agreed wed better discuss it before luckman gets here there must be something we can do refuse to seat him angst said refuse to play against him freya said no vital deeds should be offered during the play his getting a toehold here in california is bad enough if he gains more we mustnt permit it jack blau agreed he glared at walt remington how could you do it we ought to expel you and youre such a jackass you probably havent got any idea what youve done he understands bill calumine said he didnt intend to he sold to brokers and they right away thats no excuse jack blau said clem gaines said one thing we can do we can insist that he submit to an eeg i took the liberty of bringing a machine along that might bar him we ought to be able to bar him somehow should we check with us cummings and see if it has any idea jean blau asked i know its contrary to their intentions to have one man dominate both coasts they were upset when luckman pushed joe schilling out of new york city in facti remember that distinctly id prefer not to turn to the vugs bill calumine said he looked around at the group anybody else have any ideas speak up there was an uneasy silence aw come on stuart marks said cant we just he gestured you know scare him physically therere six men here against one after a pause bill calumine said im for that a little force at least we can agree to combine against him during the game itself and if he broke off someone had come in rising to her feet jean blau said folks this is the new player whos come to us from straw man special carol holt jean advanced to take the girl by the arm and lead her into the room carol this is freya and clem gaines jean and jack blau silvanus angst walter and janice remington stuart marks yule marks and over here is your bluffpartner pete garden pete this is carol holt we spent two hours picking her out for you and im mrs angst mrs angst said entering the room after carol my but this is an exciting night two new people i understand freya studied carol holt and wondered what petes reaction was he showed nothing on the surface only polite formality as he greeted the girl he seemed abstracted tonight perhaps he hadnt entirely recovered from the shock of the night before she herself had not certainly the girl from straw man special freya decided was not too terribly brightlooking and yet she appeared to have personality her hair was nicely bound up in the currentlymodish ratnest knot and her eye makeup was wellapplied carol wore lowheeled slippers no stockings and a madras wraparound skirt which made her seem freya thought a trifle hefty at the midsection but she had nice fair skin and her voice when she spoke was pleasant enough even so freya concluded pete wont go for her shes just not his kind and what is petes kind she asked herself me no not herself either their marriage had been onesided she had felt all the deep emotions and pete had simply been gloomy anticipating in some vague way the calamity which would end their relationship the loss of berkeley pete freya reminded him you still have to roll a three turning to bill calumine their spinner pete said give me the device and ill begin now how many turns am i allowed a complex rule governed the situation and jack blau went off to get the rules book to look it up together bill calumine and jack blau decided that tonight pete was entitled to six throws carol said i didnt realize he hadnt rolled his three yet i hope i havent made a trip all the way here for nothing she seated herself on the arm of a couch smoothed her skirt over her kneesfair smooth knees freya notedand lit a cigarette looking bored seated with the spinning device pete rolled his first roll was a nine to carol he said im doing the best i can in his voice there was an overtone of resentment his new relationship freya saw was getting into motion in the customary way she smiled to herself it was impossible not to take a measure of enjoyment in the situation scowling pete rolled again this time it was ten we cant start playing anyhow janice remington said brightly we have to wait for mr luckman to get here carol holt snorted smoke from her nostrils and said good god is lucky luckman a part of pretty blue fox nobody told me that she shot a brief tense glare in jean blaus direction seated with the spinner pete said i got it he rose stiffly to his feet bending bill calutnine said he sure did a real authentic three he picked up the spinner it was over now the ceremony and except for waiting on mr luckman we can go ahead patience angst said im vowsgiver this week bill ill administer the ceremony she brought out the group ring which she passed to pete garden pete stood beside carol holt who had not yet recovered from the news about lucky luckman carol and peter we are gathered here to witness your entering into holy matrimony terran and titanian law cojoin to empower me to ask you if you voluntarily acquiesce in this sacred and legal binding do you peter take carol to be your lawful wedded wife yes pete said glumly or so it seemed to freya do you carol patience angst paused because a new figure had appeared in the doorway of the condominium apartment it stood silently watching lucky luckman the big winner from new york the greatest bindman in the western world had airrived everyone in the room turned at once to look dont let me interrupt luckman said and did not budge patience then murmuringly continued the ceremony to its conclusion s so this is what the one and only lucky luckman looks like freya said to herself a brawny man stockilybuilt with a round appleshaped face all his coloration pale and strawlike a peculiar vegetable quality as if luckman had been nourished indoors his hair had a soft thin texture and did not hide the pinkish scalp at least luckman had a clean wellwashed look freya observed his clothes neutral in cut and quality showed taste but his hands    she found herself staring at his hands luckmans wrists were thick and furred with the same pale whiskerlike hair the hands themselves were small the fingers short and the skin near his knuckles was spotted with what appeared perhaps to be freckles his voice was oddly highpitched mild she did not like him there was something wrong with him he had a caponlike quality like a defrocked barred priest he looked soft where he should be hard and we really have worked out no strategy against him freya said to herself we dont know how to work together and now its too late i wonder how many of us in this room will be playing a week from now she thought we must find a way to stop this man she said to herself and this is my wife dotty jerome luckman was saying introducing to the group an ample crowhaired italianlooking woman who smiled nicely around at them all pete garden scarcely paid any attention lets get the eeg machine in here he thought he went over to bill calumine and squatted down beside him its eeg time he said softly to calumine as a starter yes calumine nodded rose and disappeared into the other room along with clem gaines presently he returned the croftsharrison machine tagging along behind him a wheeled egg with coiled receptors rows of meters sparkling it had not been used for a long time the group was quite stable until now but now pete thought its all changed we have two new members one of whom is unknown the other a patent enemy who must be fought with all weve got and he felt the struggle personally because the deed had been his luckman entrenched at the claremont hotel in berkeley now dwelt in petes own bind what could constitute a more intimate invasion than that he stared at luckman and now the short lighthaired big bindman from the east stared back neither man said anything there was nothing to say an eeg luckman said as he made out the croftsharrison machine an unusual twisting grimace touched his features why not he glanced at his wife we dont mind do we he held out his arm and calumine strapped the anode belt tightly in place you wont find any psipower in me luckman said as the cathode terminal was fixed to his temple he continued to smile presently the croftsharrison machine excreted its short spool of printed tape bill calumine as official group spinner examined it then passed it to pete together they read the tape silently conferring no psionic cephalic activity pete decided at least not at the moment it might come and go thats common certainly so anyhow dammit we cant legitimately bar luckman on this count too bad he thought and returned the tape to calumine who then passed it to stu marks and silvanus angst am i clean luckman asked genially he seemed utterly confident and why not it was they who should worry not he obviously luckman knew it walt remington said hoarsely mr luckman im personally responsible for your having this opportunity to invade pretty blue fox oh remington luckman said he extended his hand but walt ignored it say dont blame yourself i would have gotten in eventually anyhow dotty luckman spoke up thats so mr remington dont feel bad my husband can get into any group he likes her eyes shone proudly what am i luckman growled some sort of monster i play fair nobody ever accused me of cheating i play the same as you do to win he looked from one of them to the next waiting for an answer he did not seem much perturbed however it was evidently a merely formal question luckman did not expect to change their feelings and perhaps he did not even want to pete said we feel mr luckman that you already have more than your share the game wasnt contrived as an excuse to achieve economic monopoly and you know it he was silent then because that fairly well expressed it the others in the group were nodding in agreement i tell you what luckman said i like to see everyone happy about things i dont see any reason for this suspicion and gloom maybe youre not very confident in your own abilities maybe thats it anyhow how about this for every california title deed i win he paused enjoying their tension ill contribute to the group a title deed for a town in some other state so no matter what happens youll all still wind up bindmen    maybe not here on the coast but somewhere he grinned showing teeth so regular that to pete garden anyhowthey seemed palpably false thanks freya said frigidly no one else spoke is it meant to be an insult pete wondered maybe luckman sincerely intends it maybe hes that primitive that naive about human feelings the door opened and a vug came in it was pete saw the district commissioner us cummings what did it want he wondered had the titanians heard about luckmans move to the west coast now the vug after its fashion greeted the members of the group what do you want bill calumine asked it sourly were just about to sit down to play the vugs thoughts came to them sorry for this intrusion mr luckman what is the meaning of your presence here produce your document of validation that entitles you to enter this group oh come on luckman said you know ive got the deed he reached into his coat brought out a large envelope what is this a gag extending pseudopodia the vug inspected the deed then returned it to luckman you neglected to notify us of your entry into this group i dont have to luckman said its not mandatory nevertheless us cummings declared its protocol what is your intention here at pretty blue fox luckman said i intend to win the vug seemed to contemplate him it was silent for a time thats my legal right luckman added he seemed a little nervous you dont have any power to intercede in this youre not our masters let me refer you to the concordat of 2095 signed between your military and the un all you can do is make recommendations and give assistance to us when its requested i didnt hear anybody request your presence here in this room tonight he looked around at the group for agreement bill calumine said to the vug we can handle this thats right stuart marks said so beat it vuggy go on he went to get the vugstick it was propped up in the corner of the room us cummings with no further thoughts in their direction departed as soon as it had gone jack blau said lets begin playing  right bill calumine agreed producing his key he went to the locked closet a moment later he was laying out the large gameboard on the table in the center of the room the others began drawing up their chairs making themselves comfortable deciding whom they wanted to sit beside coming up to pete carol holt said we probably wont do too well at first mr garden since were not used to each others styles it was time pete judged to tell her about joe schilling listen he said i hate to say this but you and i may not be partners very long oh carol said why not she eyed him pete said im frankly more interested in winning berkeley back than i am in anything elsethan in luck as the popular phrase has it in the biological sense despite the fact he thought that both the terran and titanian authorities who set up the game considered it primarily a means to that end rather than to the economic end youve never seen me play carol said she walked swiftly over to the comer of the room and stood with her hands behind her back regarding him im quite good perhaps good pete agreed but hardly good enough to beat luckman and thats the issue ill play with you tonight but tomorrow i want to bring in someone else no offense meant but i am offended carol said he shrugged then youll have to be offended who is this person you want to bring in joe schilling v the rare record man the girls honeycolored eyes widened with amazement but i know luckman beat him pete said but i dont think he can do it again schilling is a good friend of mine i have confidence in him which is more carol holt said than you can say about me right youre not even interested in seeing how i play youve already decided i wonder why you bothered to go through with the marriage ceremony pete said for tonight i suggest carol said that we not even bother about tonight her cheeks had flushed dark red now she was quite angry now listen pete said uneasy now wanting to mollify her i didnt intend to you dont want to hurt me carol holt said but you have very much at straw man special my friends had all the respect in the world for me im not used to this she blinked rapidly for gods sake pete said horrified he took her by the hand propelled her from the room and outside into the night darkness listen i just wanted to prepare you in case i brought joe schilling in berkeley was my place of bind and im just not going to give up on it dont you understand it has nothing to do with you you may be the best bluffplayer on earth for all i know he took hold of her by the shoulders gripping her now lets stop this bickering and go back in theyre starting to play carol sniffed just a minute she found a handkerchief in her skirt pocket and blew her nose come on you fellows bill calumine called from within the apartment silvanus angst appeared in the doorway were starting he giggled seeing them the economic part right now mr garden if you please together pete and carol returned to the lighted living room and the game we were discussing our strategy pete said to calumine but as regards to what janice remington said and winked freya glanced first at pete and then at carol she said nothing however the others were already involved in care fully watching luckman they did not care about anything else title deeds were starting to appear reluctantly one by one they were put into the pot basket mr luckman yule marks said bluntly you have to put up the berkeley deed its the only california real estate you own she and the rest of the group watched intently as luckman deposited the large envelope in the basket i hope yule said that you lose it and never show up here again youre an outspoken woman luckman said with a wry smile his expression then seemed to harden it became rigid fixed in place pete thought he intends to beat us hes made up his mind he has no more liking for us than we have for him its going to be a dirty hard business i withdraw my offer luckman said of giving you title deeds to towns outside california he picked up the stack of numbered cards and began to shuffle them magnificently in view of your hostility its clear that we cant have even the semblance of cordiality thats right walt remington said in answer none else spoke but it was as evident to luckman as it was to pete garden that each person in the room felt the same way draw for first play bill calumine said and took a card from the shuffled deck to himself jerome luckman thought these people are going to pay for their attitude i came here legally and decently i did my part and they wouldnt have that his turn to draw a card came he drew and it was a seventeen my lucks showing up already he said to himself he lit a delicado cigarette leaned back hi his chair and watched as the others drew its a good thing dave mutreaux refused to come here luckman realized the precog was right they did have the eeg machine to try out as a ploy they would have had him dead to rights evidently you go first luckman calumine said with your seventeen youre high man he seemed resigned as did the others the luckman luck luckman said to them as he reached for the round metal spinner watching pete out of the comer of her eye freya gaines thought he and she had a fight outside there carol when she came back in looked as if she had been crying too bad freya said to herself with relish they wont be able to play as partners she knew carol wont be able to put up with petes melancholy his hypochondria and in her hes simply not going to find a woman wholl put up with him i know hell turn back to me in a relationship outside the game hell have to or crack up emotionally it was her turn to play this initial round was played without the element of bluff the visible spinner was used not the cards freya spun obtained a four damn she thought as she moved her piece four spaces ahead on the board that brought her to a sadlyfamiliar square excise tax pay 500 she paid silently janice remington the banker accepted the bills how tense i am freya thought everyone here is including luckman himself which of us she wondered will be the first to call luckman on a bluff wholl have the courage and if they challenge him will they succeed will they be right she herself shrank from it not me she said to herself pete would she decided hell be the first he really hates the man it was petes turn now he spun a seven and began moving his piece his face was expressionless chapter 6 being somewhat poor joe schilling owned an ancient cantankerous moody autoauto which he called max unfortunately he could not afford a newer one as usual today max balked at the instructions given it no it said im not going to fly out to the coast you can walk im not asking you im telling you joe schilling told it what business do you have out on the coast anyhow max demanded in its surly fashion its motor had started however i need repairwork done it complained before i undertake such a long trip why cant you maintain me properly everybody else keeps up their cars youre not worth keeping up joe schilling said and got into the autoauto seated himself at the tiller then remembered that he had forgotten his parrot eeore damn it he said dont leave without me i have to go back for something he got out of the car and strode back to the record shop key in hand the car made no comment as he returned with the parrot it seemed resigned now or perhaps the articulation circuit had collapsed are you still there schilling asked the car of course i am cant you see me take me to san rafael california schilling said the time was early morning he would probably be able to catch pete garden at his protem apartment pete had called late last night to report on the first encounter with lucky luckman the moment he heard petes gloomy tone of voice joe schilling had known the result of the game luckman had won the problem now pete said is that hes got two california title deeds so he doesnt have to risk berkeley any more he can put up the other one you should have had me right from the start schilling said after a pause pete said well ive got a little problem carol holt garden my new wife she rates herself a fine bluffplayer is she shes good pete said but but you still lost ill start out for the coast tomorrow morning and now here he was as promised starting out with two suitcases of personal articles and his parrot eeore ready to play against luckman wives schilling thought more of a problem than an asset the economic aspects of our lives should never have been melded hopelessly with the sexual it makes things too complex blame that on the titanians and their desire to solve our difficulties with one neat solution covering all what theyve actually done is gotten us entangled even more thoroughly pete hadnt said any more about carol but marriage had always been primarily an economic entity schilling reflected as he steered his autoauto up into the earlymorning new mexico sky the vugs hadnt invented that they had merely intensified an already existing condition marriage had to do with the transmission of property of lines of inheritance and of cooperation in careerlines as well all this emerged explicitly in the game and dominated conditions the game merely dealt openly with what had been there implicitly before the car radio came on then and a male voice addressed schilling this is kitchener im told youre leaving my bind why business on the west coast it irritated him that the bindman of the area should burst into the situation and meddle but that was colonel kitchener a fussy elderly spinstertype retired oflicer who nosed into everybodys business i didnt give you permission kitchener complained you and max schilling said pardon kitchener berated him maybe i just wont want to let you back into my bind schilling i happen to know youre going to carmel to play the game and if youre as good as all that as good as all what schilling broke in thats to be demonstrated as yet if youre good enough to play at all kitchener said you ought to be playing for me it was obvious that most of the story had leaked out schilling sighed that was one difficulty with such a diminished worldpopulation the planet had become like one extensive small town with everyone knowing everyone elses business maybe you could practice in my group kitchener offered and then play against luckman when youre back in shape after all you wont do your friends any good coming in cold as you are dont you agree i may be cold schilling said but im not that cold first you denied being good and now you deny being bad kitchener said youre confusing me schilling ill permit you to go but i hope if you do show your old talent youll bring some of it to our table out of a sense of loyalty to your own bindman good day good day kitch schilling said and broke the circuit well his trip to the coast had already earned him two enemies his autoauto and colonel kitchener a bad harbinger schilling decidedmost unlucky the car he could afford to have antagonistic to his enterprise but not a man as powerful as kitchener after all the colonel was right if he did have any talents at the game they should be used to support his own bindman not someone else all at once max spoke up you see what you got yourself into it said accusingly i realize i should have checked with my bindman and gotten his approval schilling agreed you hoped to sneak out of new mexico unnoticed max said it was true schilling nodded yes it was decidedly a bad beginnning waking in the stillunfamiliar apartment in san rafael peter garden jumped in surprise at the sight of the tousled head of brown hair beside him the bare smooth shoulders so eternally invitingand then remembered who she was and what had happened the evening before he got out of bed without waking her went into the kitchen in his pajamas to search for a package of cigarettes a second california deed had been lost and joe schilling was on his way from new mexico thats how things stood he recalled and he now had a wife whohow exactly did he evaluate carol holt garden it would be good to know precisely where he stood in relation to her before joe schilling put in his appearance    and that could be any time now he lit a cigarette put the tea kettle on the burner as the tea kettle started to thank him he said be quiet my wifes asleep the tea kettle obediently warmed in silence he liked carol she was pretty and to say the least great guns in bed it was as simple as that she was not terribly pretty and many of his wives had been as good in bed and better and he did not like her inordinately everything about his feelings was commensurate with reality her feelings however were excessive to carol this new marriage challenged her sense of identity by way of her prestige as a woman a wife as a gameplayer that was a lot outside the apartment on the street below the two mcclain children played quietly he heard their tense muted voices going to the kitchen window he looked out and saw them the boy kelly the girl jessica involved in some sort of knife game absorbed they were oblivious to anything else to him to the vacant automaintained city around them i wonder how their mother is pete said to himself patricia mcclain whose story i know    returning to the bedroom he got his clothes carried them to the kitchen and silently dressed not waking up carol im ready the tea kettle said all at once he took it from the burner started to make instant coffee and then changed his mind lets see if mrs mcclain will fix breakfast for the bindman he said to himself before the fulllength mirror in the apartments bathroom he stared at himself concluded that he looked while not stunning at least adequate and then noiselessly he set off out of the apartment and down the stairs to the ground floor hi kids he said to kelly and jessica hi mr bindman they murmured absorbed where can i find your mother he asked them they both pointed pete taking a deep breath of sweet earlymorning air walked that way with fast strides feeling hungry in several waysdeep and intricate ways his autoauto max landed at the curb before the apartment building in san rafael and joe schilling stiffly slid across the seat opened the door manually and stepped out he rang the proper buzzer and an answering buzz unlocked the massive front door carefully locked to bar intruders who no longer exist he said to himself as he climbed the carpeted stairs to the fourth floor the apartment door stood open but it was not pete garden waiting for him it was a young woman with disorderly brown hair and a sleepy expression who are you she said a friend of petes joe schilling said are you carol she nodded drew her robe around her selfconsciously petes not here i just got up and hes gone i dont know where can i come in schilling asked and wait if you like im going to have breakfast she padded away from the door and schilling followed he found her once more in the kitchen of the apartment cooking bacon on the range the tea kettle announced mr garden was here but he left did he say where he was going schilling asked it he looked out the window and then left the rushmore effect built into the tea kettle did not amount to much the tea kettle was little help schilling seated himself at the kitchen table how are you and pete getting along oh we had a dreadful first evening carol said we lost pete was so mordse about it  he didnt say one word all the way home here from carmel and even after we got here he hardly said anything to me as if he thought it was my fault she turned sadly toward joe schilling i just dont know how were going to go on pete seems almost suicidal hes always been that way schilling said dont blame yourself oh carol said nodding well thanks for letting me know could i have a cup of coffee certainly she said putting the tea kettle back on are you by any chance the friend he vidphoned last night after the game yes schilling said he felt embarrassed he had come here to replace this woman at the game table how much did she know of petes intentions in many ways schilling thought petes a heel when it comes to women carol said i know what youre here for mr schilling umm schilling said cautiously im not going to step aside she said as she spooned ground coffee into the midpart of the aluminum pot your history of playing isnt a good one i believe i can do better than you hmm schilling said nodding after that he drank his coffee and she ate breakfast in awkward strained silence both of them waiting for pete garden to return patricia mcclain was dustmopping the living room of her apartment she glanced up saw pete and then she smiled a slow secretive smile the bindman cometh she said and continued dustmopping hello pete said selfconsciously i can read your mind mr garden you know quite a bit about me from having discussed me with joseph schilling so you met mary anne my oldest daughter and you find her stunningly attractive as schilling put it  as well as much like me pat mcclain glanced up at him her dark eyes sparkled dont you think mary anne is a little young for you youre one hundred and forty or thereabouts and shes eighteen pete said since the hynes gland operations never mind patricia said i agree and youre also thinking that the real difference between me and my daughter is that im embittered and shes still fresh and feminine this coming from a man who steadily contemplates ruminates about suicide i cant help it pete said clinically its obsessive thinking its involuntary i wish i could get rid of it doctor macy told me that decades ago ive taken every pill there is  it goes away for a time and then returns he entered the mcclain apartment had breakfast yes patricia said and you cant eat here it isnt proper and i dont care to fix it for you ill tell you truthfully mr garden i dont wish to get involved with you emotionally in fact the idea of it repels me why he said as evenly as possible because i dont like you and whys that he said not retreating either physically or psychologically because youre able to play the game and im not patricia said and because you have a wife a new one and yet youre here not there i dont like your treatment of her being a telepath is quite a help pete said when it comes to making evaluations of other peoples vices and weaknesses it is can i help it pete said if im attracted to you and not to carol you cant help what you feel but you could avoid doing what youre doing im perfectly aware of your reason for being here mr garden but dont forget im married too and i take my marriage seriously which you do not but of course you dont you have a new wife every few weeks or so every time theres a severe setback at the game her disgust was manifest her lips were tightly compressed and her black eyes flashed he wondered what she had been like before discovery of her psionic talent had barred her from the game much like i am now patricia said i doubt that he said he thought about her daughter i wonder if shell be this way in time he speculated i suppose it depends on whether she has her mothers telepathic talent or not and if so mary anne doesnt have it patricia said none of the children do weve looked into it already then she wont wind up like you have he thought perhaps not patricia said soberly all at once she said i wont let you stay here mr garden but you can drive me into san francisco if you wish i have shopping to do there and we can stop at a restaurant and have breakfast if you care to he started to agree and then he remembered joe schilling i cant because of business strategy talks about the game yes obviously he couldnt deny it you put that first before anything else even with your socalled deep feelings toward me i asked joe schilling to come here i have to be around to greet him that seemed selfevident to him apparently it did not seem so to her however but there was nothing he could do about that her cynicism was too deeply embedded for him to affect it in any way dont judge me patricia mcclain said you may be right but she moved away from him holding her hand up to her forehead as if physically suffering i still cant stand it mr garden sorry he said ill leave pat i tell you what she said ill meet you this afternoon at onethirty in downtown san francisco at market and third we can have lunch together do you think you can slip away from your wife and your gameplaying friend for that yes he said then its agreed patricia said and she went on dustmopping pete said tell me why you changed your mind about seeing me what did you pick up in my mind it must have been fairly important id rather not say patricia answered please the telepathic faculty has one basic drawback you may not know this it tends to pick up too much its too sensitive to marginal or merely latent thoughts in people what the old psychologists called the unconscious mind theres a relationship between the telepathic faculty and paranoia the latter is the involuntary reception of other peoples suppressed hostile aijid aggressive thoughts what did you read in my unconscious pat iread a syndrome of potential action if i were a precog i could tell you more you may do it you may not but she glanced up at him its a violent act and it has to do with death death he echoed perhaps patricia said youll attempt suicide i dont know its inchoate still it has to do with deathand with jerome luckman and its so bad that it would make you reverse yourself in your decision not to have anything to do with me patricia said it would be wrong of me after picking up such a syndrome to simply abandon you thanks he said tartly i dont want it on my conscience id hate to hear on nats katz program tomorrow or the day after that youd taken that overdose of emphytal that youre obsessively preoccupied with she smiled at him but it was a colorless smile devoid of joy ill see you at onethirty pete said at third and market unless he thought the inchoate syndrome having to do with violence and death and jerome luckman becomes actual before then it may patricia said somberly thats another quality of the unconscious it stands outside of time you cant tell in reading it whether youre picking up something minutes away from actualization or days away or even years its all blurred together wordlessly pete turned and strode out of the apartment away from her the next he knew he was riding in his car high over the desert he knew instantly that it was much later snapping on the radio transmitter he said give me a time signal the mechanical voice from the speaker said six pm mountain standard time mr garden where am if he asked himself where is this he said to the car nevada it looked like nevada barren and empty the car said eastern utah when did i leave the coast two hours ago mr garden what have i done during the last five hours the car said at ninethirty you drove from marin county california to carmel to the game room in the carmel condominium apartment building whom did i see i dont know continue he said breathing shallowly you stayed there one hour then you came out and took off for berkeley berkeleyi he said you landed at the claremont hotel you stayed there only a short time only a few minutes then you took off for san francisco you landed at san francisco state college and went into the administration building you dont know what i did there do you no mr garden you were there an hour then you came out and took off once more this time you landed at a parking lot in downtown san francisco at fourth and market youjparked me there and set out on foot going which way i didnt notice go ahead you returned at twofifteen got back in and directed me to fly in an east course i have done so ever since and we didnt land anywhere since san francisco no mr garden and by the way im very short of fuel we should come down at salt lake city if possible all right he said head that way thank you mr garden the car said and altered its course pete sat for a time and then he switched on the transmitter and vidphoned his apartment in san rafael on the small screen carol holt gardens face appeared oh hello she said where are you bill calumine called hes getting the group together early this evening to discuss strategy he wants to be sure both you and i are there did joe schilling show up yes what do you mean you came back to the apartment early this morning and sat out in your car talking to him you talked out there so i wouldnt hear pete said hoarsely what happened after that i dont understand your question what did i do he demanded did i go anywhere with joe schilling where is he now i dont know where he is now carol said what on earth is the matter with you dont you know what you did today do you always have periods of amnesia pete grated just tell me what happened you sat in the car talking to joe schilling and then he went off i guess anyhow you came back upstairs alone and said to mejust a second i have something on the stove she disappeared from the screen he waited counting the seconds until at last she returned sorry lets see you came back upstairs carol paused meditating we talked then you went downstairs again and thats the last ive seen of you until you called just now what did you and i talk about you told me that you wanted to play with mr schilling as your partner tonight carols voice was cold withdrawn emotionally we shall i say discussed it argued about it actually in the end she glared at him if you dont know i dont he said carol said theres no reason why i should tell you ask joe if you want to know im sure you informed him where is he i have no idea carol said and broke the connection the tiny image of her on the vidscreen died im sure he said to himself that i arranged with joe for him to play as my partner tonight but thats not the problem the problemit was not what did i do but why dont i remember i may have done nothing at all that is nothing that was unusual or important although going to berkeley    perhaps i wanted to pick up some of my things which id left he decided but according to the rushmore effect of the car he had not gone to his old apartment he had gone to the claremont and that was where lucky luckman was staying evidently he had seenor had tried to seeluckman he thought id better get hold of joe schilling find him and talk to him tell him that for reasons unknown to me im missing almost an entire day the shock of what pat mcclain saidcould that explain it and evidently he had met patricia in downtown san francisco as they had agreed if so what had they done what was his relationship with her now perhaps he had been successful perhaps on the other hand he had only antagonized her further no way to tell and the visit to san francisco state college    evidently he had sought out pats daughter mary anne good lord what a day to losel using the cars transmitter he phoned joe schillings record shop in new mexico and got a rushmore variety of answering device mr schilling is not currently here he and his parrot are on the pacific coast you can contact him through marin county bindman peter garden at san rafael oh no you cant pete said to himself and cut the connection with a wild swipe of his hand after a time he vidphoned freya garden gaines oh hello there peter freya said looking pleased to hear from him where are you were all supposed to get together at im hunting for joe schilling he said you know where he is no i havent seen him did you bring him out to the coast to play against luckman if you hear from him pete said tell him to go to my apartment in san rafael and stay there okay freya said is something wrong maybe so he said and rang off i wish to hell i knew he said to himself to the car he said do you have enough fuel to head directly back to san rafael without stopping at salt lake city no mr garden the car said get your damn fuel then he told it and then lets get back to california as fast as possible all right but theres no point in being angry at me it was your instructions that brought us to this place he cursed at the car and sat impatiently waiting as it nosed down toward deserted vast salt lake city below chapter 7 when finally he got back to san rafael it was evening he switched on the landing lights of the car and came to rest at the curb before his apartment building as he stepped out a shape emerged from the darkness hurrying toward him pete it was he made out patricia mcclain she wore a long heavy coat and her hair was tied back in a knot what is it he said catching her air of alarm and urgency just a second she came close to him breathless gasping her eyes dilated with fear i want to scan your mind whats happened my god she said you dont remember the whole days lost to you pete be careful i better gomy husbands waiting goodbye ill see you as soon as i can dont try to get in touch with me ill call you she stared at him for an instant and then she disappeared down the street rushing away into the evening darkness he went on then up the stairs to his apartment in the living room large redbearded joseph schilling sat waiting seeing him schilling at once rose to his feet where have you been pete said is carol here or are you alone he glanced around him there was no sign of her i havent seen her since this morning since the three of us were together here in the apartment i was talking to your former wife freya and she told me that you how did you get in pete said if carol isnt here the apartment was unlocked pete said listen joe somethings happened today you mean luckmans disappearance staring at him chilled pete said i didnt know luckman had disappeared of course you do youre the one who told me now schilling stared back at him they were both silent schilling said you called me from your car you caught me at the conapt in carmel i was studying recordings of your groups past gameplays and then later on i heard it over nats katz afternoon program luckman disappeared this morning and he hasnt been found no schilling grabbed pete by the shoulder why dont you remember i had an encounter with a telepath pat mcclain you told me you were remarkably upset i could tell i know you you alluded to something she had picked up in your unconscious something having to do with your obsessive suicidal impulses you said and then you suddenly signed off and broke the circuit i saw her again just now pete said her warning probably it had to do with luckmans disappearance did patricia think he had something to do with it schilling said ill fix you a drink he went over to the cabinet by the large living room windows while i was waiting for you i managed to find where you keep it this scotch isnt bad but as far as im concerned theres nothing quite like i havent eaten dinner pete said i dont want a drink he went into the kitchen to the refrigerator with the vague idea of preparing some sort of meal theres some very fine kosherstyle corn beef i picked it up at a delicatessen in san francisco it and dark bread and slaw okay pete got the food out we dont have much time to get to carmel were supposed to be there early but if luckman doesnt show up are the police looking for him have they been called in i dont know you didnt say and neither did katz pete said did i tell you how i happened to know about it no this is terrible pete said he cut two thick slices of the dark bread his hands were shaking why i dont know why doesnt it strike you that way schilling shrugged maybe it would be a good thing if someone did him in we should have such bad luck every day wouldnt this solve our collective problems his widow would have to play his hand and we can beat dotty luckman i know her system and its mediocre he too cut himself some of the dark bread and helped himself to the kosherstyle corn beef the vidphone rang you get it pete said he felt dread sure schilling strode into the living room hello his voice came to pete bill calumines voice somethings come up i want everyone at carmel immediately okay well leave now schilling returned to the kitchen i heard pete said  leave a note for your wife carol telling her what  dont you know that either telling her to get down to carmel the agreement we arrived atrememberis for me to play the hands but for her to sit in and watch from behind me seeing what i draw and how i play each turn you dont remember that either do you pete said no she wasnt very pleased schilling got his hat and coat from the closet but you figured youd come up with something just dandy there come on its time to leave bring your corn beef sandwich along as they left the apartment and came out into the hall they met carol holt garden she was stepping from the elevator her face looked tired seeing them she halted well she said listlessly i suppose you heard schilling said we heard from bill calumine if thats what you mean i mean carol said about luckman since ive already called the police if you want to see come downstairs by the elevator the three of them descended to the ground floor and carol led them to her car parked behind schillings and petes at the curb i discovered it in midflight she said woodenly leaning against the hood of the car hands in her coat pockets i was flying along and i happened to wonder if id left my purse at my old apartment where i and my previous husband lived i was there today getting some things i had forgotten pete and joe schilling opened the door to her car i switched on the dome light carol said and saw it it must have been put in while i was parked at my old apartment but its barely possible that it was done even earlier when i was here this morning she added you can see that heitis way down on the floor out of sight i touched it trying to find my purse she was silent then by the glare of the dome light pete saw the body jammed behind the front seats of the car it was luckman no doubt of it even in death the round plumpcheeked face was recognizable it was not ruddy now it was in the artificial light a pulpy gray i called the police at once carol said and arranged to meet them here sirens were now audible in the black sky above them a long way off chapter 8 facing the members of the group pretty blue fox bill calumine said ladies and gentlemen jerome luckman has been murdered and every one of us is a suspect thats the situation there isnt much more i can tell you at this time naturally there will be no gameplaying tonight silvanus angst giggled and said i dont know who did it but whoever it iscongratulations he laughed waiting for the others to join in be quiet freya said to him sharply coloring angst said but im right its the best news its not good news that were under suspicion bill calumine said shortly i dont know who did it or even if any of us did it and im not even sure that its to our advantage we may find enormous legal complications in getting back the two california title deeds which we lost to him i just dont know its too soon what we need is legal advice right stuart marks said and around the room the other members of the group nodded we should jointly hire an attorney a good one to help protect us jack blau said and to advise us how best to get those two deeds back a vote walt remington said irritably bill calumine said we dont need to vote its obvious we need an attorney the police will be here any time now let me ask this he glanced around the room if one of you did itand i stress the word ifdoes that person want to declare himself now there was silence no one moved with a brief smile calumine said that takes care of that anyhow if one of us killed luckman hes not going to say would you want him to jack blau asked not particularly calumine said he turned to the vidphone if no one objects ill call bert barth my attorney in los angeles and see if he can get right up here all right again he glanced around no one objected all right then calumine said and dialed schilling said whoever did it for whatever motives his voice was harsh putting it in carol holt gardens car was a vicious and brutal act wholly inexcusable frey a smiled we can condone the murder but not putting the body in mrs gardens car an odd era were living in you know im right schilling said to her freya shrugged into the vidphone bill calumine was saying give me mr barth its an emergency he turned toward carol who sat by pete and joe schilling on the large center sofa im particularly thinking of your protection mrs garden in our hiring of legal counsel since it was found in your car carols no more a suspect than anyone else pete said at least he thought i hope not why should she be after all she notified the police as soon as she found it lighting a cigarette schilling said to him so i arrived too late ill never have my opportunity to get back at lucky luckman stuart marks murmured unless you already have meaning what schilling said turning toward him and surveying him hell what do you think i mean marks said on the vidscreen the firm elongated features of the los angeles attorney bert barth had formed and barth was already in the process of advising the group theyll come as a team he was explaining to bill calumine one vug one terran thats customary in capital crimes ill get up there as soon as i can but itll take me at least half an hour be prepared for them both to be excellent telepaths thats customary too but remember evidence obtained through telepathic scanning is not legal in a terran court of law thats been solidly established calumine said it sounds to me like a violation of the provision in the us constitution against a citizen being forced to testify against himself that too barth said nodding now the whole group was silent listening to the conversation between calumine and their attorney the police telepaths can scan you and determine if youre guilty or innocent but other evidence has to be produced for it to stand up in court they will use their telepathic faculties to the hilt however you can be sure of that the rushmore effect of the apartment now chimed and then announced two persons are outside wishing to enter police stuart marks asked one titanian the rushmore effect said and one terran are you police it was addressing the visitors they are police it informed the group shall i admit them have them come on up bill calumine said after an exchange of glances with his attorney barth continued lwhat your people must be prepared for is this by law the authorities can disband your group until this crime is solved in principle its supposed to act as a determent to future crimes committed by gameplaying groups actually it works out more as a simple punitive gesture punishing everyone involved dismally freya said disband the groupoh no sure jack blau said grimly didnt you know that its the first thing i thought of when i heard about luckmans death i knew theyd disband us he glared around the room as if seeking for the person responsible for the crime well maybe they wont walt remington said there was a knock at the apartment door itself the police ill stay on the vidphone bert barth offered instead of trying to make it up there i can probably advise you better this way from the vidscreen he looked toward the door freya opened the door there stood a lean tall young terran and beside him a vug the terran said im wade hawthorne he produced a blackbacked leather wallet which contained their identification the vug merely rested in its customary fashion overtaxed by the ascent to this floor stitched to it was the namethread eb black come in bill calumine said striding toward the door im the groups spinner bill calumines my name he held the door wide and the two officers entered the apartment the vug eb black coming first we wish first to talk to mrs carol holt garden the vug thoughtpropagated to the group since the corpse was found in her car im carol garden she rose to her feet stood steady and calm as the team of police turned to face her do we have your permission to scan you telepathically wade hawthorne asked her she glanced at the vidscreen tell them yes bert barth said to the two police he said im barth their legal counselor in los angeles ive advised my clients this group pretty blue fox to cooperate with you fully they will all be open for telepathic scanning but they understandand i know you do toothat any evidence you obtain in this fashion cant be entered in a court of law thats correct hawthorne said and walked over to carol the vug slid slowly after him and there was silence it appears to be as mrs garden related on the phone the vug eb black said presently she discovered the corpse in midflight and at once notified us to its companion the vug continued i find no indication that mrs garden had any prior knowledge of the corpses presence in her car she does not appear to have had anything to do with luckman prior to that discovery do you agree i agree hawthorne said slowly but he glanced around the room there is something in connection with her husband mr peter garden id like to examine you next mr garden pete his throat dry rose to his feet can i talk with our attorney a moment in private he said to the policeman hawthorne no hawthorne said in a pleasant even voice hes already advised you on this matter i see no reason to permit you to im aware of what his advice is pete said im interested in learning the consequences if i were to refuse he walked across the room to the vidphone well he said to barth youll become a prime suspect barth said but its your right you can refuse id advise you not to because if you do theyll never stop hounding you theyll scan you sooner or later anyhow pete said i have an aversion to having my mind read once they discovered his amnesia he realized they would be certain he had killed luckman and perhaps he had the obvious was confronting him brutally whats your decision hawthorne asked him youve probably begun to scan me already pete said barth of course was right if he refused they would scan him anyhow if not now then some other time go ahead he said and felt sick and weary he walked over to the two of them and stood with his hands in his pockets time passed no one spoke ive picked up the matter which mrs garden was thinking about the vug thoughtradiated to its companion have you  yes hawthorne said nodding to pete he said you have no actual memory of today do you youve reconstructed it from remarks made by your autoauto or at least by alleged remarks you can question the rushmore of my car pete said it informed you hawthorne said slowly that you paid a visit to berkeley today but you dont actually know if it was to see luckman and if so whether you did see him or not i cant imagine why this block in your mind exists was it selfimposed and if so how i cant tell you the answer to that pete said as you can certainly read for yourself hawthorne said drily anyone intending to commit a capital crime would of course know that telepaths would be brought in he would have to deal with that and nothing could possibly benefit him more than a segment of amnesia entering to block out that period of his activities to eb black he said i would presume we should take mr garden into custody the vug answered perhaps but we must examine the others as a matter of course to the group it declared you are ordered to disband as a gameplaying organization from this moment on it is illegal for any of you to come together for the purpose of playing bluff this ruling will hold until the murderer of jerome luckman has been found they turned instinctively to the vidscreen barth said its legal as i warned you he seemed resigned speaking for the group bill calumine said to the two police i protest this hawthorne shrugged he did not seem particularly worried by calumines protest i have picked up something unusual the vug said to its companion please scan the rest of the group as a whole and see if you agree glancing at him hawthorne nodded he walked slowly about the room from person to person and then back to the vug yes he said mr garden is not the only person here unable to recall what he did today in all six persons in this group show similar lapses of memory mrs remington mr gaines mr angst mrs angst mrs calumine and mr garden none of them have intact memories astonished pete garden looked around the room and saw by the expressions on the faces of the other five that it was true they were in the same situation that he was and probably like himself each of them had believed his situation unique so none of them had discussed it i can see hawthorne said that were going to have difficulty establishing the identity of the murderer of mr luckman in view of this however im sure it can be done it merely will take longer he glared at the group with displeasure in the kitchen of the conapt janice remington and freya gaines fixed coffee the others remained in the living room with the team of detectives how was luckman killed pete asked hawthorne by a heatneedle evidently were having an autopsy performed of course well have certain knowledge then what the hell is a heatneedle jack blau asked hawthorne said a sidearm left over from the war they were all called in but a large number of servicemen kept theirs and we find them being used every now and then it employs a laser beam and is accurate from quite a distance assuming there is no intervening structure coffee was brought hawthorne accepted a cup and seated himself his companion the vug eb black declined on the vidscreen the miniature image of their attorney bert barth said mr hawthorne whom do you intend to hold all six persons with defective memories id like to know now because im going to have to ring off this line soon i have other commitments it seems probable well hold the six and release the others do you find that objectionable mr barth hawthorne seemed amused mrs angst broke in theyre not going to hold me not without a charge they can hold youanybodyseventytwo hours at least barth said for observation there are several blanket charges they can bring in so dont fight that mrs angst after all a man has been killed this is a serious matter thanks for the help bill calumine said to barth a little bit ironically it seemed to pete id like to ask you one more thing can you begin work getting the stricture on our meeting for gameplaying removed til see what i can do barth said give me some time there was a case last year in chicago a group there was dissolved under the same statute for several weeks and naturally they took it to court as i recall the group won its case anyhow ill look into it barth rang off were lucky jean blau said that weve got legal representation she looked frightened going over to her husband she stood close by him  silvanus angst said i still say were better off luckman would have wiped us out he grinned at the two police maybe i diet it like you say i dont remember frankly if i did it im glad he did not appear to have any fear of the police pete envied him mr garden hawthorne said i catch a very interesting thought from you early this morning you were warned by someonei cant catch by whomthat you were about to commit an act of violence having to do with luckman am i correct rising he walked over to pete would you mind thinking as clearly as possible about this his tone was informal pete said this is a violation of my rights he wished that the attorney were still on the vidphone as soon as barth had rung off the attitude of the police had stiffened the group was now at their mercy not precisely hawthorne said were governed by many regulations our pairing off biracially is to protect the rights of those we investigate actually were hampered by such an arrangement bill calumine said did both of you agree on shutting down our group or was that its idea he jerked his head in the direction of eb black i fully concur in the action of banning pretty blue fox hawthorne said despite what your inborn prejudices may tell you pete said youre wasting your time baiting him for his association with the vugs it was obvious that hawthorne was used to it by now he probably encountered it everywhere the two detectives went coming over beside pete joe schilling said softly im just not satisfied with the attitude of that bert barth hes giving in too easily a good aggressive lawyer would stand up for us more perhaps so pete said it had seemed that way to him too i have my own attorney back in new mexico his name is laird sharp ive known him professionally and socially a long time im familiar with his way of operating and its in great contrast to barths and since theyre evidently going to book you id like to see you get him instead of this attorney of calumines i know he could get you right out the problem pete said is that military law still prevails in many situations the concordat between terrans and titanians had been a military one he felt pessimistic if the police want to take us in they probably can he said to schilling something was terribly wrong something with enormous power was in operation it had acted against six members of the group already and who knew what its limits were if it could deplete them of their recent memories the vug eb black said i agree with you mr garden it is unique and disconcerting up to now we have not run into anything exactly like it individuals to avoid being scanned have procured electroshock and managed to obliterate memorycells but that does not seem to be the case here how can you be sure of that stuart marks said maybe these six people acted together to get electroshock equipment they could have done it through almost any psychiatrist and psychiatric hospital the machinery is readily available he glowered at pete hostilely look what youve done because of you our group has been banned because of me pete said because of the six of you marks looked sullenly around at all of them obviously one or more of you killed luckman you should have looked into the legal situation before you did it mrs angst said we did not kill luckman you dont know that stuart marks said you dont remember right so dont try to have it both ways remembering that you didnt do it and not remembering that you did bill calumine spoke up his voice was icy marks damn it you have no moral right for acting this way what do you mean by accusing your fellow groupmembers im going to insist that we continue to act together and not let ourselves be split apart this way if we start to fight among ourselves and begin accusing each other the police will be able to he broke off be able to what hawthorne said mildly be able to locate the slayer thats all we intend to do and you know it calumine said to the group i still insist we should stick together those with intact memories and those without were still a group and its up to the police to voice the accusations not us to stuart marks he said if you do that again ill ask for a vote to have you dropped from the group thats not legal marks said and you know it i still say what i said one or more of these six people killed luckman and i dont see why we should protect them it means the obliteration of our group its to our best interests to have the slayer discovered then we can resume playing walt remington said whoever killed luckman didnt do it for himself he did it for all of us it may have been the act of an individual an individual decision but we all benefited that person saved our hides and as far as im concerned its ethically loathsome for a member of the group to assist the police in apprehending him shaking with anger he faced stuart marks we didnt like luckman jean blau said and we were terribly afraid of him but that didnt create a mandate for someone to go out and kill him supposedly in the name of the group i agree with stuart we should cooperate with the police in determining who did it a vote silvanus angst said yes carol agreed we should decide on policy are we to hang together or are we as individuals to betray one another ill tell you my vote right now its thoroughly wrong for any of us to the policeman wade hawthorne interrupted her you have no choice mrs garden you must cooperate with us its the law you can be compelled to i doubt that bill calumine said joe schilling said im going to contact my own attorney in new mexico he crossed the room to the vidphone clicked it on and began to dial is there any way freya was saying to hawthorne that the lapsed memories can be restored not if the braincells in question have been destroyed hawthorne answered and i assume thats the case its hardly likely that these six members of pretty blue fox have simultaneously suffered hysterical loss of memory he smiled briefly pete said to him my day was fairly well reconstructed by the rushmore effect of my car and it didnt put me at any time near a psychiatric hospital where i could have obtained electroshock you stopped at san francisco state college hawthorne said and their psych department possesses ets equipment you could have gotten it there what about the other five pete said their days have not been reconstructed by rushmore circuitry as has yours hawthorne said and there are major omissions in yours a good deal of your activity today is far from clear joe schilling said i have sharp on the vid you want to talk to him pete ive sketched the situation briefly the vug eb black said suddenly just a moment mr garden it conferred telepathically for a time with its colleague and then it said to pete mr hawthorne and i have decided not to book any of you theres no direct evidence involving any one of you in the crime but if we let you go you must agree to carry tattletales with you at all times inquire of your attorney mr sharp if that will be acceptable what the hell is a tattletale joe schilling asked a tracing device hawthorne said it will inform us where each of you are at all times does it have a telepathic content pete asked no hawthorne said although i wish it had on the vidscreen laird sharp youthful and activelooking said i heard the proposal and without going into it any further id be inclined to label it as a clear violation of these peoples rights suit yourself hawthorne said then well have to book them ill have them out at once sharp said to pete he said dont allow them to hook any sort of monitoring devices to you and if you discover they have rip them off ill fly right out there its obvious to me that your rights are being resoundingly violated joe schilling said to pete do you want him yes pete said bill calumine said ihave to agree he seems to have more on the ball than barth turning to the group calumine said i offer the motion that we retain this man sharp collectively hands went up the motion carried ill see you shortly then sharp said and broke the connection a good man schilling said and reseated himself pete felt a little better now it was a good feeling he thought to have someone battling hard on your side the group as a whole seemed less stunned now they were coming out of their stupor im going to make a motion freya said to the group i move that we order bill calumine to step down and that we elect someone else someone more vigorous as group spinner astonished bill calumine said wwhy because you sicked that donothing attorney on us freya said that bert barth who just let the police walk all over us jean blau said true but its still better to let him remain as spinner than to stir up trouble but trouble pete said is something we cant avoid were in it already after an interval he said i second freyas motion  taken by surprise the group began to murmur vote silvanus angst said snickering he added i agree with pete i vote for calumines removal bill calumine stared at pete and said hoarsely how could you second a motion like that do you want someone more vigorous i would think you wouldnt why not pete said because calumine said his face red with anger his voice trembling you personally have so much to lose what causes you to say that the detective hawthorne asked him calumine said pete killed jerome luckman how do you know that hawthorne said frowning he called me and told me he was going to do it calumine said early this morning if you had scanned me more thoroughly you would have found that it wasnt very far down in my mind for a moment hawthorne was silent evidently scanning calumine then he turned to the group thoughtfully he said what he says is true the memory is there in his mind butit wasnt there earlier when i scanned him a little while ago he glanced at his partner eb black it was not there the vug replied in agreement i scanned him too yet its clearly there now they both turned toward pete chapter 9 joe schilling said i dont think you killed luckman pete i also dont think you called bill calumine and told him you were going to i think someone or something is manipulating our minds that thought was not in calumines head originally both cops scanned him he was silent then the two of them were at the hall of justice in san francisco awaiting the arraignment it was an hour later when do you think sharp will be here pete said any time schilling paced about calumine obviously is sincere he actually believes you said that to him there was a commotion down the corridor and laird sharp appeared wearing a heavy blue overcoat and carrying a briefcase he strode toward them ive already talked to the district attorney i got them to lower the charge from homicide to simply knowledge of a homicide and deliberate concealment of the knowledge from the police i pointed out that youre a bindman you own property in california you can be trusted out on bail well have a bond broker in here and get you right out pete said thanks its my job sharp said after all youre paying me i understand youve had a change of authority in your group whos your spinner now that calumine is out my quondam wife frey a garden gaines pete said your quondam or your goddam wife sharp asked cupping his ear anyhow the real question is can you swing the group so that theyll help pay my fee or are you alone in this joe schilling said it doesnt matter in any case ill guarantee your fee i ask sharp said because my fee would differ according to whether its an individual or a group he examined his watch well lets get the arraignment over and the bond broker in here and then lets go somewhere and have a cup of coffee and talk the situation over fine schilling said nodding weve got a good man here he said to pete without laird youd be in here on an unbailable offense i know pete said tensely let me ask you point blank laird sharp said across the table to pete did you kill jerome lucky luckman pete said i dont know he explained why scowling laird sharp said six persons you say name of god whats going on here so you could have killed him you or any one of you or several or even all he fingered a sugar cube ill tell you a piece of bad news the widow luckman dotty is putting great pressure on the police to break this case that means theyre going to try for a conviction as soon as possible and itll be before a military court    its that damn concordat weve never gotten out from under it i realize that pete said he felt tired the police have given me a written transcript of the investigating officers report sharp said reaching into his briefcase i had to pull a few strings but here it is he brought a voluminous document from his briefcase and pushed his coffee cup aside to lay it out on the table ive already glanced at it this eb black found in your memory an encounter with a woman named patricia mcclain who told you that you were about to perform an act of violence having to do with luckmans death no pete said having to do with luckman and death its not quite the same thing the lawyer eyed him keenly very true garden he returned to the document counselor schilling said they have no real case against pete outside of that phony memory that calumine has theyve got nothing sharp nodded except the amnesia and you share that with five other groupmembers but the problem is that theyll be digging around trying to get more dope on you beginning from the assumption that you are guilty and by starting with that as a premise god knows what they may be able to find you say your autoauto said you dropped by berkeley sometime today    where luckman was staying you dont know why or even if you managed to reach him god you may have done it all right garden but well presume you didnt for the purposes of our case is there anyone that you personally suspect and if so why no one pete said incidentally sharp said i happen to know something about mr calumines attorney bert barth hes an excellent man if you deposed calumine on barths account you were in error barth is inclined to be cautious but once he gets started you cant pull him loose pete and joe schilling glanced at each other anyhow sharp said the die is cast i think your best bet garden is to look up your psionic woman friend pat mcclain and find out what you and she did today and what she read in your mind while you were with her okay pete said he agreed shall we go there now sharp said putting his document away in his briefcase and rising to his feet its only ten oclock we may be able to catch her before she goes to bed also standing up pete said theres a problem she has a husband whom ive never met if you understand me sharp nodded i see he meditated maybe shed be willing to fly here to san francisco ill give her a call if not is there any other place you can think of not your apartment joe schilling said carols there he regarded pete somberly i have a place now you dont remember but you found it for me in your present bind san anselmo its about two miles from your own apartment if you want ill call pat mcclain she no doubt remembers me both she and al her husband have bought jussi bjoerling records from me ill tell her to meet us at my apartment fine pete said joe schilling went to the vidphone in the back of the restaurant to call hes a nice guy sharp said to pete as they waited yes pete agreed do you think he killed luckman startled pete jerked his head stared at his lawyer dont become unglued sharp said smoothly i was just curious you are my client garden as far as im professionally concerned everyone else is a suspect over and above you even joe schilling whom ive known for eightyfive years youre a jerry pete said surprised with such energy pete had assumed sharp to be no more than forty or fifty yes sharp said im a geriatric like yourself one hundred and fifteen years old he sat broodingly twisting a match folder up into a ball schilling could have done it hes hated luckman for years you know the story of how luckman reduced him to penury then why did he wait until now glancing at him sharp said schilling came out here to play luckman again right he was positive he could beat luckman if they ever tangled again hes been telling himself that all this time ever since lucky beat him maybe joe got out here all prepared to play for your group against luckman then lost his nerve    discovered at the last moment that when it came right down to it he couldnt beat luckman after allor at least feared he couldnt i see pete said so he was in an untenable position committed to playing and beating luckman not merely for himself but for his friends    and he knew he simply could not do it what other way out than to sharp broke off joe schilling was crossing the nearempty restaurant returning to the table its a compelling theory anyhow sharp said and turned to greet joe schilling whats an interesting theory joe said seating himself sharp said the theory that a single enormously powerful agency is at work manipulating the minds of the members of pretty rlue fox turning them into a corporate instrument of its will you put it a little grandiosely joe said but in the main i feel that must be the case as i said to pete what did pat mcclain say pete asked shell meet us here joe said so lets have a second cup of coffee itll take her another fifteen minutes she had gone to bed a half hour later pat mcclain wearing a light trench coat lowheeled slippers and slacks entered the restaurant and walked toward their table hello pete she said to him she looked pale and her eyes were unnaturally dilated mr schilling she nodded to joe and she studied laird sharp as she seated herself im a telepath you know mr sharp yes i read that you know youre petes lawyer pete thought i wonder howif at allpats telepathic talent could assist me at this point i had no doubts about sharp and i dont in any way shape or form accept his theory about joe schilling glancing at him pat said ill do all i can to help you pete her voice was low but steady she had herself under control the panic of a few hours ago was gone you dont remember anything that happened between us this afternoon no he admitted well pat said you and i got on astonishingly well for two people who are married to someone else entirely sharp asked her was there anything in petes mind when he met you this afternoon about lucky luckman yes she said a tremendous desire for luckmans death then he didnt know luckman was dead joe said is that correct sharp asked her pat nodded he was terribly afraid he felt that she hesitated he felt that luckman would beat joe again as he did years ago pete was going into a psychological fugue a retreat from the whole situation regarding luckman no plans to kill luckman i assume sharp said no pat said if it can be established that luckman was dead by onethirty joe schilling said wouldnt that clear pete probably sharp said to pat he said youd testify to this in court yes she nodded despite your husband after a pause she again nodded sharp said and would you let the telepaths of the police scan you oh christ she said drawing back why not sharp said youre telling the truth arent you yyes pat said but she gestured theres so much more so many personal matters schilling said wryly ironic as a telepath shes been scanning peoples private ruminations all her life now when its a question of a telepath scanning her but you dont understand pat said i understand schilling said you and pete had an assignation today youre having an affair correct and your husband isnt to know and petes wife isnt to know but thats the stuff life is made of you know that perfectly well if you allow the telepathic police to scan you possibly you will save petes life isnt that worth being scanned for or perhaps youre not telling the truth and theyd find out im telling the truth pat said angrily her eyes blazing buti cant allow the police telepaths to scan me and thats that she turned to pete im sorry maybe someday youll know why it has nothing to do with you or with my husband finding out there really isnt anything to find out anyhow we met walked had lunch then you left sharp said astutely joe this girls obviously mixed up in something extralegal if the police scan her shes lost pat said nothing but the expression on her face showed that it was so the attorney was right what could she be involved with pete wondered strange  he would never have imagined it about her pat mcclain seemed too withdrawn too encapsulated maybe its a pose she said picking up his thought sharp said so we cant get you to testify for pete even though its direct evidence that he did not know of luckmans death he eyed her intently i heard on tv she said that luckman is believed to have been killed sometime late today near dinner time so she gestured my testimony wouldnt help anyhow did you hear that sharp said odd i listened too on the way here from new meixco and according to nats katz the time of luckmans death had still to be established there was silence its too bad sharp said acidly that we cant read your mind mrs mcclain as you can read ours it might prove somewhat interesting that clown nats katz pat said hes not a newscaster anyhow hes a pop singer and disc jockey he sometimes is six hours behind in his socalled news briefs with steady fingers she got out a cigarette and lit up go out and track down a news vendor get a late edition of the chronicle its probably in that sharp said it doesnt matter because in any case you wont testify for my client to pete she said forgive me hell pete said if you wont testify you wont and anyhow he tended to believe her about the time of death having been established as late in the day what sort of extralegal activity would a pretty woman like you be mixed up in sharp asked her pat said nothing it could be noised about sharp pointed out to her and then the authorities would want to scan you whether you testify in this or not let it drop pete said to him sharp glanced his way shrugged whatever you say thank you pete pat said she sat smoking silently i have a request sharp said after a time to make of you mrs mcclain as you have probably already gleaned from mr gardens mind five other members of pretty blue fox have shown up with amnesia regarding the days activities yes pat nodded undoubtedly they will all be attempting to determine what they did and did not do today in the manner that pete employed checking with various rushmore units and so on would you be willing to assist us by scanning these five people in the next day or so to determine what theyve learned why joe said i dont know why sharp answered and i wont know until she gives us the information but he hesitated chewing his lower lip and scowling id like to find out if the paths of these six people intersected at any moment during the day during the nowforgotten interval give us your operational theory joe said sharp said its possible that all six acted in concert as part of a complicated farreaching plan they may have elaborated it some time in the past and had that removed by electroshock also with a grimace joe schilling said but they didnt know until just the other day that lucky luckman was coming out here the death of luckman may be nothing more than a symptom of a greater strategy sharp said his presence here may have spoiled the effective operation of this larger plan he eyed pete what do you say to this i say youve got a theory much more ornate than the situation itself pete said possibly sharp said but evidently it was necessary to mentally blind six people today when one would expect two or three to be sufficient two in addition to the murderer himself would have made prosecution difficult enough i think but i could be wrong whoever is behind this may simply be playing it as cautious as he can the master gameplayer pete said pardon sharp said oh yes bluff the game mrs mcclain can never play because shes too talented the game that cost joe schilling his status and luckman his life doesnt this homicide make you a trifle less bitter mrs mcclain maybe youre not so badly off after all how did you know that pat asked him about what you term my bitterness ive never seen you before tonight have i or is my bitterness that wellknown its all in the briefcase sharp said patting the leather side of it the police got it from petes mind he smiled at her now let me ask you something mrs mcclain as a psiperson do you have contact with very many other psiindividuals sometimes pat said do you know first hand the range of psionic ability for instance we all know about the telepath the precog the psychokinetic but what about the rarer talents for example is there a subvariety of psi which deals with the alteration of the contents of other peoples psyches a sort of mental psychokinesis pat said notto my knowledge no you understand my question yes she nodded but to my knowledge which is limited no psi talents exist which could explain the amnesia of the six members of pretty blue fox nor the alteration in bill calumines mind regarding what pete did or did not say to him you say your knowledge is limited sharp scrutinized her as he spoke then its not impossible that such a talent and such a psipersoncould exist why would a psionic individual want to kill luckman pat asked why would anyone want to sharp said obviously someone did but someone in pretty blue fox they had reasons to sharp said quietly there is nothing in the makeup of the members of pretty blue fox which would account for the capacity to cripple the memories of six people and alter the memory of a seventh does such a capacity exist anywhere that you know of pat asked him yes sharp said during the war both sides used techniques of that sort it goes all the way back to midtwentieth century soviet brainwashing procedures horrible pat said with a shudder one of the worst periods in our history at the door of the restaurant an automated news vending machine appeared with a late edition of the chronicle its rushmore effect bleated out special coverage of the luckman murder case the restaurant except for their party was empty the news vending machine being homotropic headed toward them still bleating the chronicles own circuit investigates and discloses startling new details not found in the examiner or the news callbulletin it waved the newspaper in their faces getting out a coin sharp inserted it in the slot of the machine it at once presented him with a copy of the paper and rolled back out of the restaurant to hunt for more people what does it say pat asked as sharp read the lead article youre correct sharp said nodding time of death believed to be late in the afternoon not too long before mrs garden found the body in her car so i owe you an apology joe schilling said maybe pats also a precog the news wasnt out yet when she told you that she previewed this edition in advance of its release how useful shed be in the newspaper business not very funny pat said thats one of the reasons why psis become so cynical were so mistrusted no matter what we do lets go somewhere that we can get a drink joe schilling said to pete he said whats a good bar in the bay area you must know the situation around here youre a sophisticate urbane and cosmopolitan pete said we can go to the blind lemon in berkeley its almost two centuries old or should i stay out of berkeley he asked sharp no reason to avoid it sharp said youre not going to run into dotty luckman at a bar thats certain you dont have a bad conscience about berkeley do you no pete said i have to go home pat mcclain said goodbye she rose to her feet accompanying her to her car pete said thanks for coming on the dark san francisco sidewalk she stood by her car stubbing her cigarette out with the toe of her slipper pete she said even if you did kill luckman or helped kill him istill want to know you better we were just beginning to become acquainted this afternoon i like you a lot she smiled at him what a mess this all is you crazy gameplayers taking it so seriously willing at least some of you to kill a human being because of it maybe i am glad i had to leave it maybe im better off she stood on tiptoe kissed him ill see you ill vidphone you when i can he watched her car shoot rapidly into the night sky its signal lights winking red on and off whats she mixed up in he asked himself as he walked back into the restaurant shell never tell me perhaps i can find out through her children for some reason it seemed important for him to know you dont trust her joe schilling said to him as he sat down once more at the table thats too bad i think shes fundamentally an honest person but god knows what shes got herself involved in youre probably right to be suspicious im not suspicious pete said im just concerned sharp said psipeople are different from us you cant put your finger on exactly what it isi mean in addition totheir talent that girl    he shook his head i was sure she was lying how long has she been your mistress garden did you say shes not pete said at least he didnt think so a shame to forget something like that not to be certain in that aspect of ones life i dont know whether to wish you luck or not laird sharp said thoughtfully wish me luck pete said i can always use it in that area so to speak schilling said and smiled when he got home to his apartment in san rafael pete garden found carol standing at the window gazing sightlessly out she barely greeted him her voice was distant and muted sharp got me out on bail pete said theyve got me charged with i know her arms folded carol nodded they were here the two detectives hawthorne and black mutt and jeff only i cant figure out which is the easygoing one and which is supposed to be tough they both seem tough what were they doing here he demanded searching the apartment they had a warrant hawthorne told me about pat after a pause pete said thats a shame no i think its very good now we know exactly where we stand you and i in relationship to each other you dont need me in the game joe schilling does that and you dont need me here either im going back to my own group ive decided she pointed toward the bedroom of the apartment and he saw on the bed two suitcases maybe you can help carry them downstairs to the car carol said i wish youd stay he said to be jeered at nobodys jeering at you of course they are everybody in pretty blue fox is or will be and itll be in the papers maybe so he said he hadnt thought of that if i hadnt found luckmans body carol said i wouldnt know about pat and if i didnt know about pat i would have triedand possibly succeededin being a good wife of yours so you can blame whoever killed luckman for destroying our marriage maybe thats why they did it he said killed luckman i doubt it our marriage is hardly that important how many wives have you had in all eighteen carol nodded ive had fifteen husbands thats thirtythree combinations of male and female and no luck as they say from any of them when did you last bite into a piece of rabbitpaper carol smiled thinly oh i do all the time it wouldnt show up from us yet its too early not with the new west german kind pete said i read about it it records even an impregnation only an hour old good grief carol said well i dont have any of the new kind i didnt even know it existed i know an all night drugstore pete said in berkeley lets fly over there and pick up a packet of the new rabbitpaper why theres always the chance the possibility and if we had luck you wouldnt want to dissolve our relationship all right carol said you take my two suitcases down to the car and well fly over to the all night drugstore and if i am pregnant ill come back here with you and if im not then goodbye okay he said there wasnt much else he could say he couldnt force her to remain do you want me to stay carol asked as he carried the two heavy suitcases downstairs to her car  yes he said why he didnt know why well he began forget it carol said and got into her car you follow me in yours i dont feel like riding with you pete presently he was in the air over san rafael riding on the beam created by her tail lights he felt melancholy damn those cops he thought anything to split the members of the group apart so they can be picked olf one at a time but it wasnt the two police that he blamed it was himself if she hadnt found out this way she would have run onto it by another i let my life become overly complex he decided too much for me to keep straight and handle carol has certainly received a bad handful of cards since she came to pretty blue fox first luckman arrives then i bring schilling in to take her place at the gametable then luckmans body turns up in her car now this no wonder she wants to leave why should she stay he asked himself give me one good reason he couldnt they flew over the bay and soon they were gliding down to land at the deserted parking lot of the drugstore carol slightly ahead of him stood waiting as he got out of his car and walked over to her its a nice night she said so you used to live here what a shame you lost it just think pete if you hadnt lost it id never have met you yeah he said as they ascended the ramp and entered the drugstore that and so much else would never have come about the rushmore effect of the drugstore greeted them they were its only customers good evening sir and madame how may i assist you please the obedient mechanical voice issued from a hundred speakers hidden throughout the great litup place the entire structure had focused its attention on the two of them carol said do you know anything about a new instant rabbitpaper yes madame the drugstore answered eagerly a recent scientific breakthrough from ag chemie at bonn ill get it for you from an orifice at the end of the glass counter a package tumbled it slithered to a halt directly before them and pete picked it up the same price as the old he paid the drugstore and then he and carol walked back out onto the dark deserted parking lot all for us carol said this enormous place with a thousand lights on and that rushmore circuit clamoring away its like a drugstore for the dead a spectral drugstore hell pete said its very much for the living the only problem is there just arent enough of the living maybe theres one more than there was carol said she removed a strip of rabbitpaper from the pack unwrapped it placed it between her even white teeth and bit what color does it turn she asked as she examined it same as the old white for non pete said green for positive in the dim light of the parking lot it was hard to tell carol opened her car door the dome light switched on and she inspected the strip of rabbitpaper by it the paper was green carol looked up at him and said im pregnant weve had luck her voice was bleak her eyes filled with tears and she looked away ill be goddamned she said brokenly the first time ive ever been in all my whole life and with a man whos already she was silent breathing with difficulty and staring fixedly past him into the night darkness this calls for a celebration he said it does she turned to face him we get to go on the radio and broadcast it to the whole world oh carol said nodding yes thats right thats the custom wont everyone be jealous of us my crawling into her car pete snapped on the transmitter of the radio to the emergency allwave broadcast position hey he exclaimed you know what this is pete garden of pretty blue fox at carmel california carol holt garden and i have only been married a day or so and tonight we made use of the new type of west german rabbitpaper i wish i were dead carol said you what he stared at her in disbelief youre nuts this is the most important event of our lives weve added to the population this makes up for luckmans death it balances it out right he caught hold of her hand and compressed it until she moaned say something into the mike mrs garden carol said i wish all of you the same luck ive had tonight youre goddam right pete shouted into the microphone every single one of you listening to me so now we stay together carol said softly yes pete agreed thats right thats what we decided and what about patricia mcclain the hell with everybody else in the world except you pete said except you and me and the baby carol smiled a little okay lets drive back do you think youre able to drive well leave your car here and both go back in mine and ill drive quickly he carried her suitcases to his own car then took her by the arm and led her just sit down and take it easy he said seating her in his car and fastening the safety belt in place pete she said do you realize what this means in terms of the game she had turned pale every deed in the pot belongs to us automatically butthere is no game right now there arent any deeds in the pot because of the police ban but we must get something well have to look it up in the manual okay he said only halflistening to her he was busy carefully guiding his car up into the sky pete she said maybe you win back berkeley not a chance there was at least one game subsequent to that the one we played last night true she nodded well have to apply to the rules committee in the jay satellite for an interpretation i guess he frankly did not care about the game at this moment the idea of a child a son or daughter  it obliterated everything else in his mind all that had happened of late everything connected with luckmans arrival and death and the banning of the group luck he thought this late in my life one hundred and fifty years after so many tries after the failure of so many many combinations with carol beside him he drove his car back across the dark bay to san rafael and their apartment when they got there and had gone upstairs pete headed at once for the medicine cabinet in the bathroom what are you doing carol asked following after him pete said im going out on a whingding im going to get drunker than ive ever before been in my life from the medicine cabinet he got down five snoozex tablets and after hesitating a handful of methamphetamine tablets these will help he explained to carol goodbye he swallowed the pills gulping them down all together and then headed for the hall door its a custom he paused briefly at the door when you learn youre going to have a child ive read about it he saluted her gravely and then shut the door after him a moment later he was downstairs back in his car starting out alone in the dark night searching for the nearest bar as the car shot upward into the sky pete thought god knows where im going or when ill get back i certainly dont knowand dont care wheeoo he shouted exultantly as the car climbed the sound of his voice echoed back to him and he shouted again chapter 10 roused from her sleep freya gaines groped for the switch of the vidphone groggily she found it and snapped it on  lo she mumbled wondering what time it was she made out the luminous dial of the clock beside the bed three am good grief carol holt gardens features formed on the vidscreen freya have you seen pete carols voice was jerky anxietystricken he went out and he still hasnt come back i cant go to sleep no freya said of course i dont know where he is did the police let him go hes out on bail carol said doyou have any idea what places he might stop at the bars are all closed now i was waiting for two oclock thinking hed show up no later than twothirty but try the blind lemon in berkeley freya said and started to cut the connection maybe hes dead she thought threw himself off one of the bridges or crashed his car finally carol said hes celebrating good god why freya said im pregnant fully awake freya said i see astonishing right away you must be using that new rabbitpaper theyre selling yes carol said i bit a piece tonight and it turned green thats why petes out i wish hed come back hes so emotional first hes depressed and suicidal and then you worry about your problems ill worry about mine freya cut in congratulations carol i hope its a baby and then she did break the connection the image faded into darkness the bastard freya said to herself with fury and bitterness she lay bach supine staring up at the ceiling clenching her fists and fighting back the tears i could kill him she said to herself i hope hes dead i hope he never comes back to her would he come here she sat up stricken what if he does she asked herself beside her in the bed clem gaines snored on if he shows up here i wont let him in she decided i dont want to see him but for some reason she knew pete would not come here anyhow hes not looking for me she realized im the last person hes looking for she lit a cigarette and sat in bed smoking and staring straight ahead of her silently the vug said mr garden when did you first begin to notice these disembodied feelings as if the world about you is not quite real as long ago as i can remember pete said and your reaction depression ive taken thousands of amitriptyline tablets and they only have a temporary effect do you know who i am the vug asked lets see pete said cogitating the name doctor phelps floated through his mind doctor eugen phelps he said hopefully almost right mr garden its doctor er philipson and how did you happen to look me up do you perhaps recall that pete said how could i help looking you up the answer was obvious because youre there or rather here stick out your tongue why as a mark of disrespect pete stuck out his tongue ahhh he said additional comment is unnecessary the points made how many times have you attempted suicide four pete said the first when i was twenty the second when i was forty the third no need to go on how close did you come to success very close yes sir especially the last time what stopped you a force greater than myself pete said how droll the vug chuckled i mean my wife betty that was her name betty jo she and i met at joe schillings rare record shop betty jo had breasts as firm and ripe as melons or was her name mary anne her name was not mary anne doctor er philipson said because now youre speaking of the eighteenyearold daughter of pat and allen mcclain and she has never been your wife i am not qualified to describe her breasts or her mothers in any case you scarcely know her all you know about her in fact is that she devoutly listens to nats katz whom you cant stand you and she have nothing in common you lying son of a bitch pete said oh no tin not lying im facing reality and thats exactly what youve failed to do thats why youre here youre involved in an intricate sustained illusionsystem of massive proportion you and half of your gameplaying friends do you want to escape from it no pete said i mean yes yes or no what does it matter he felt sick at his stomach can i leave now he said i think ive spent all my money the vug doctor er philipson said you have twentyfive dollars in time left well id rather have the twentyfive dollars that raises a nice point of professional ethics in that you have already paid me then pay me back pete said the vug sighed this is a stalemate i think i will make the decision for both of us do i have twentyfive dollars worth of help left that i can give you it depends on what you want you are in a situation of insidiouslygrowing difficulty it will probably kill you shortly just as it killed mr luckman be especially careful for your pregnant wife she is excruciatingly fragile at this point i will i will doctor er philipson said your best bet garden is to bend with the forces of the times theres little hope that you can achieve much really youre one person and you do in some respects properly see the situation but physically youre powerless who can you go to eb black mr hawthorne you could try they might help you they might not now as to the timesegment missing from your memory yes pete said the timesegment missing from my memory how about that you have fairly well reconstructed it by means of the rushmore effect mechanisms so dont fret unduly but did i kill luckman ha ha the vug said do you think im going to tell you are you out of your mind maybe so pete said maybe im being naive he felt even sicker now too sick to go on any further wheres the mens room he asked the vug or should i say the humans room he looked around squinting to see the colors were all wrong and when he tried to walk he felt weightless or at least much lighter too light he was not on earth this was not oneg pulling at him it was only a fraction he thought im on titan second door to the left the vug doctor er philipson said thank you pete said walking with care so that he would not float up and rebound from one of the whitepainted walls listen he said pausing what about carol im giving up patricia nothing rfteans anything to me except the mother of my child nothing means anything you mean doctor er philipson said a joke and a poor one im merely commenting on your state of mind things are seldom what they seem skimmilk masquerades as cream a wonderful statement by the terran humorist ws gilbert i wish you luck and i suggest you consult eb black hes reliable you can trust him im not so sure about hawthorne the vug called loudly after pete and close the bathroom door after you so i wont have to listen its disgusting when a terran is sick pete shut the door how do i get out of here he asked himself ive got to escape howd i get here to titan in the first place how much time has passed daysweeks perhaps i have to get home to carol god he thought they may have killed her by now the way they killed luckman they who he did not know it had been explained to him  or had it had he really gotten his one hundred and fifty dollars worth perhaps it was his responsibility not theirs to retain the knowledge a window high up in the bathroom he moved the great metal paper towel drum over stood on it and managed to reach the window stuck shut painted shut he smashed upward against its wooden frame with the heels of his hands creaking the window rose room enough he hoisted himself up squeezed through darkness the titanian night  he dropped fell listening to himself whistle down and down like a feather or rather like a bug with large surf acearea in proportion to mass whooee he shouted but he heard no sound except the whistle of his falling he struck pitched forward lay suffering the pain in his feet and legs i broke my goddam ankle he said to himself he hobbled up to his feet an alley trashcans and cobblestones he hobbled toward a street light to his right a red neon sign daves place a bar lie had come out the back out of the mens washroom minus his coat he leaned against the wall of a building waiting for the numbing pain in his ankles to subside a rushmore circuit cruising past automatic policeman are you all right sir yes pete said thank you just stopped toyou know what nature called he laughed thanks the rushmore cop wheeled on what city am i in he asked himself the air damp smelled of ashes chicago st louis warm foul air not the clean air of san francisco he walked unsteadily down the street away from daves place the vug inside cadging drinks clipping terran customers rolling them in an educated way he felt for his wallet in his pants pocket gone jesus christ he felt at his coat there it was he sighed in relief those pills i took he thought didnt mix with the drinks or rather did mix thts the problem but im okay not hurt just a little shaken up and scared and im lost ive lost myself and my car and separately car he called trying to summon its autoauto mech system its rushmore effect sometimes it responded sometimes not chance factor lights twin beams his car rolled along the curb bumped to a halt by him mr garden here i am listen pete said fumbling finding the door handle where are we for chrissakes pocatello idaho for chrissakes 1 its gods truth mr garden i swear it pete said youre awfully articulate for a rushmore circuit arent you opening the car door he peered in blinking in the glare of the dome light peered suspiciously and in fright someone sat behind the tiller after a pause the figure said get in mr garden why he said so i can drive you where you want to go i dont want to go anywhere he said i want to stay here why are you looking at me so funny dont you remember coming and getting me it was your idea to do the towndo several towns as a matter of fact she smiled it was a woman he saw that now who the hell are you he said i dont know you why you certainly do you met me at joseph schillings rare record shop in new mexico mary anne mcclain he said then he got slowly into the car beside her whats been going on mary anne said calmly youve been celebrating your wife carols pregnancy but howd i get mixed up with you first you dropped by the apartment in marin county i wasnt there because i was at the san francisco public library doing research my mother told you and you flew to san francisco to the library and picked me up and we drove to pocatello because you had the idea that an eighteenyearold girl would be served in a bar in idaho and she isnt in san francisco as we found out was i right no so you went in alone to daves place and ive been sitting out here in the car waiting for you and you just now came out of that alley and began yelling i see he said he lay back against the seat i feel sick i wish i was home mary anne mcclain said ill drive you home mr garden the car now had lifted into the sky pete shut his eyes howd i get mixed up with that vug he said after a time what vug in the bar i guess doctor something philipson how would i know they wouldnt let me in well was there a vug in there didnt you see in i saw in i went in at first but there was no vug while i was there but of course i came right back out they made me leave im quite a heel pete said staying inside drinking while you sat out here in the car i didnt mind mary anne said i had a nice conversation with the rushmore unit i learned a lot about you didnt i car yes miss mcclain the car said it likes me mary anne said all rushmore effects like me she laughed i charm them evidently pete said what time is it about four am he couldnt believe it how come the bar was still open they dont allow bars open that late in any state maybe i looked at the clock wrong mary anne said no pete said you looked at it right but somethings wrong somethings terribly wrong ha ha mary anne said  he glanced at her at the tiller of the car sat the shapeless slime of a vug car pete said instantly whats at the tiller tell me mary anne mcclain mr garden the car said but the vug still sat there he saw it are you sure pete said positive the car said the vug said as i said i can charm rushmore circuits where are we going pete said home to take you back to your wife carol and then what and then im going home to bed what are you he said to it what do you think you can see tell someone about it tell mr hawthorne the detective or better yet tell eb black the detective eb black would get a kick out of it pete shut his eyes when he opened them again it was mary anne mcclain sitting there beside him at the tiller of the car you were right he said to the car or were you he wondered god he thought i wish i was home i wish i hadnt come out tonight im scared joe schilling he could help me aloud he said take me to joe schillings apartment mary anne or whatever your name is at this time of night youre crazy hes my best friend in all the world itll be five am when we get there hell be glad to see me pete said with what i have to tell him and whats that mary anne said cautiously he said you know about carol the baby oh yes mary anne said she nodded as freya said 1 hope its a baby  freya said that who to to carol how do you know mary anne said you telephoned carol from the car before we went into daves place you wanted to be sure she was all right she was very upset and you asked why and she said that she had called frey a looking for you and freya had said that damn that freya pete said i dont blame you for feeling like that shes a hard schizoid type it sounds like we studied about that in psych do you like school love it mary anne said do you think you could be interested in an old man of one hundred and fifty years youre not so old mr garden just confused youll feel better after i get you home she smiled at him briefly im still potent he said as witness carols impregnation whooee he cried three cheers mary anne said just think one more terran in the world isnt that delightful we dont generally refer to ourselves as terrans pete said we generally say people you made a mistake oh mary anne said nodding mistake noted pete said is your mother part of this is that why she didnt want the police to scan her yep mary anne said how many are in it oh thousands mary anneor rather the vugsaid despite what he saw he knew it to be a vug just thousands and thousands all over the planet but not everyones in on it pete said because you still have to hide from the authorities i think i will tell hawthorne mary anne laughed reaching into the glove compartment pete fumbled about mary anne removed the gun the car informed him she was afraid if the police stopped you and they found it theyd put you back in jail thats right mary anne said you people killed luckman why she shrugged i forget sorry whos next the thing what thing mary anne her eyes sparkling said the thing growing inside carol bad luck mr garden its not a baby he shut his eyes the next he knew they were over the bay area almost home mary anne said and youre just going to let me off he said why not i dont know he was sick then in the comer of the car like an animal would be mary anne said nothing after that and he said nothing either what a terrible night this had been he thought to himself it should have been wonderful my first luck and instead and now he could not reasonably dwell on the theme of suicide because the situation had become worse was too bad for that to be a solution my own problems are problems of perception he realized of understanding and then accepting what i have to remember is that theyre not all in it the detective eb black isnt in it and doctor philipson he or it isnt in it either i can get help from something somewhere sometime right you are mary anne said are you a telepath he said to her i very much certainly darn right am but he said your mother said you werent my mother lied to you pete said is nats katz the center of all this yes she said i thought so he said and lay back against the seat trying not to be sick again mary anne said here we are the car dipped down skimmed above the deserted pavement of a san rafael street give me a kiss she said before you get out she brought the car to a halt at the curb and looking up he saw his apartment building the light was on in his window carol was still up waiting for him or else she had fallen asleep with the lights on a kiss he echoed really yes really mary anne said and leaned expectantly toward him i cant he said why not because he said of what you are the thing that you are oh how absurd mary anne said whats the matter with you pete youre lost in dreams i am yes she said glaring at him in exasperation you took dope tonight and got drunk and you were terribly excited about carol and also you were afraid because of the police youve been hallucinating like mad for the last two hours you thought that psychiatrist doctor philipson was a vug and then you thought i was vug to the car mary anne said am i a vug no mary anne the rushmore circuit of the car answered for the second time see she said i still cant do it he said just let me out of the car he found the door handle opened the door stepped out on the curb his legs shaking under him good night mary anne said eying him good night he started toward the door of the apartment building the car said after him you got me all dirty too bad pete said he opened the apartment building door with his key and passed on inside the door shut after him when he got upstairs he found carol standing in the hall in a short sheer yellow nightgown i heard the car drive up she said thank god youre back i was so worried about you she folded her arms selfconsciously blushing i should be in my robe i know thanks for waiting up he passed on by her went into the bathroom and washed his face and hands with cold water can i fix you something to eat or drink its so late now coffee he said would be fine in the kitchen she fixed a pot of coffee for both of them do me a favor pete said call pocatello information the vidphone autocorp and find out if theres a doctor er philipson listed all right carol clicked on the vidphone she talked for a time with a sequence of homeostatic circuits and then she rang off yes i was seeing him pete said it cost me one hundred and fifty dollars their rates are high could you tell from what the vidphone said if philipson is a terran they didnt say i got his number she pushed the pad toward him ill call him and ask he clicked the vidphone back on at fivethirty in the morning yes he said dialing a long time passed the phone at the other end rang and rang  walkin the dog seebawh seebawh  pete sang  he haveum red whisker he haveum green paw doctors expect this he said to carol there was a sharp click then and on the vidscreen a face a wrinkled human face formed doctor philipson pete asked yes the doctor shook his head blearily then scrutinized pete oh its you you remember me pete said of course i do youre the man joe schilling sent to me i saw you for an hour earlier tonight joe schilling pete said to himself i didnt know that youre not a vug are you pete said to doctor philipson is that what you called me up to ask yes pete said its very important i am not a vug doctor philipson said and hung up pete shut off the vidphone i think ill go to bed he said to carol im worn out are you okay yes she said a little tired lets go to bed together he said to her carol smiled all right im certainly glad to have you back do you always do things like this go out on binges until fivethirty am no he said and ill never do it again he thought as he sat on the edge of the bed removing his clothes he found something a match folder stuffed into his left shoe beneath his instep he set the shoe down held the match folder under the lamp by the bed and examined it carol beside him had already gotten into bed and apparently had gone directly to sleep on the match folder in his own hand penciled words we are entirely surrounded by bugs rugs vugs that was my discovery tonight he remembered my bright crowning achievement and i was afraid id somehow forget it i wonder when i wrote that in the bar on the way home probably when i first figured it out when i was talking to doctor philipson carol he said i know who killed luckman who she said still awake we all did pete said all six of us whove lost our memories janice remington silvanus angst and his wife clem gaines bill calumines wife and myself we did it acting under the influence of the vugs he held out the match folder to her read what i wrote here in case i didnt remember in case they tampered with my mind again sitting up she took the match folder and studied it  we are entirely surrounded by vugs excuse mebut i have to laugh he glared at her grimly thats why you placed that call to the doctor in idaho and asked him what you did now i understand but he isnt a vug you saw him yourself on the screen and heard him yeah thats so he admitted who else is a vug or as you started to write it mary anne mcclain shes the worst of them all oh carol said nodding i see pete thats who you were with tonight i wondered i knew it was someone some woman pete clicked on the vidphone by the bed im going to call hawthorne and black those two cops theyre not in on it as he dialed he said to carol no wonder pat mcclain didnt want to be scanned by the police pete dont do it tonight she reached out and cut the circuit off but they may get me tonight any time tomorrow carol smiled at him coaxingly please can i call joe schilling then if you want i just dont think you should talk to the police right now the way youre feeling youre in so much trouble with them already he dialed information got joe schillings new number in marin county presently schillings hairy ruddy face formed on the screen fully alert yes what is it petelisten carol called and told me the good news about your luck my god thats terrific pete said did you send me to a doctor philipson in pocatello who pete repeated the name joe schillings face screwed up in bafflement okay pete said sorry i woke you i didnt think you did wait a minute schilling said listen about two years ago when you were at my shop in new mexico we had a conversationwhat was it about it was something about the side effects of a methamphetamine hydrochloride you were taking them then and i warned you against them there was an article in scientific american by a psychiatrist in idaho i think it was this philipson you mentioned and he said that the methamphetamines can precipitate a psychotic episode i have a dim memory pete said your theory your answer to the article was that you were also taking a trifluoperazine a dihydrochloride of some sort which you swore compensated for the side effects of the methamphetamines pete said i took a whole bunch of methamphetamine tablets tonight 75 milligram ones too and you also drank yes oy gewalt you remember what philipson said in his article about a mixture of the methamphetamines and alcohol vaguely they potentiate each other did you have a psychotic episode tonight not by a long shot i had a moment of absolute truth here ill read it to you to carol pete said hand me back that match folder she passed it to him and he read from it that was my revelation joe my experience there are vugs all around us  schilling was silent a moment and then he said about this doctor philipson in idaho did you go to him is that why you ask i paid one hundred and fifty dollars to him tonight pete said and in my opinion i got my moneys worth after a pause schilling said im going to suggest something to you thatll surprise you call that detective hawthorne thats what i wanted to do pete said but carol wont let me i want to talk to carol joe schilling said rising to a sitting position in the bed carol faced the vidscreen im right here joe if you think pete should call hawthorne carol ive known your husband for years he has suicidal depressions regularly to be blunt dear hes a manicdepressive he has an affective psychosis periodically tonight because of the news about the baby hes gone into a manic phase and i for one dont blame him i know how it feels its like being reborn i want him to call hawthorne for a very good reason hawthorne has had more to do with vugs than anyone else we know theres no use my talking to pete i dont know a damn thing about vugs maybe they are all around us for all i know im not going to try to argue pete out of it especially at fivethirty in the morning i suggest you follow the same course all right carol said pete joe schilling said remember this when you talk to hawthorne anything you say may turn up later on in the prosecutors case against you hawthorne is not a friend pure and simple so go cautiously right yes pete agreed but tell me what you think was it the mixture of methamphetamines and alcohol joe schilling said sidestepping the question tell me something what did doctor philipson say he said a lot of things he said for one that he thought this situation was going to kill me as it had luckman and for me to take special care of carol and he said he paused theres little i can do to change matters did he seem friendly yes pete said even though hes a vug he broke the connection then waited a moment and then dialed the police emergency number one of the friendly ones he said to himself one whos on our side maybe it took the police switchboard twenty minutes to locate hawthorne during that time pete drank coffee and felt more and more sober hawthorne he said at last when the image formed sorry to bother you so late at night i can tell you who killed luckman hawthorne said mr garden we know who killed luckman weve got a confession thats where ive been at carmel headquarters he looked drawn and weary who pete demanded which one of the group it was nobody in pretty blue fox we moved our investigations back to the east coast where luckman started out the confession is by a top employee of luckmans a man named sid mosk as yet we havent been able to establish the motive were working on that pete clicked off the vidphone and sat in silence what now he asked himself what do i do come to bed carol said lying back down and covering herself up with the blankets shutting off the lamp pete garden went to bed it was a mistake chapter 11 he awokeand saw standing by the bed two figures a man and a woman be quiet pat mcclain said softly indicating carol the man beside her held the heatneedle pointed steadily at pete he was a man pete had never seen before in his life the man said if you make trouble well kill her the heatneedle now was aimed at carol do you understand the clock on the bedside table read ninethirty bright pale morning sunlight spilled into the bedroom from the windows okay pete said i understand patricia mcclain said get up and get dressed where pete said sliding from the bed here in front of the two of you glancing at the man patricia said in the kitchen the two of them followed after him from the bedroom to the kitchen patricia shut the door you stay with him while he dresses she said to the man ill watch his wife bringing out a second heatneedle she returned stealthily to the bedroom he wont make any trouble if carols in danger i can pick that up from his mind its acutely pronounced as the unfamiliar man held the heatneedle on him pete dressed  so your wifes had luck the man said congratulations glancing at him pete said are you pats husband thats rightthe man said allen mcclain im glad to meet you at last mr garden he smiled a thin brief smile pats told me so much about you presently the three of them were walking down the corridor of the apartment building toward the elevator did your daughter get home all right last night pete said yes patricia said very late however what i scanned in her mind was interesting to say the least fortunately she didnt go to sleep right away she lay thinking and so i got it all allen mcclain said carol wont wake up for another hour so theres no impaediate problem of her reporting him missing not until almost eleven how do you know she wont wake up pete said allen said nothing youre a precog pete asked there was no answer but it was obviously so and allen mcclain said to his wife hehe jerked his head at petemr garden here wont try to escape at least most of the parallel possibilities indicate that five out of six futures a good statistic i think at the elevator he pressed the button pete said to patricia yesterday you were concerned about my safety now this he gestured at the two heatneedles why the change because in the meantime you were out with my daughter patricia said i wish you hadnt been i told you that she was too young for you i warned you away from her however pete pointed out as you read in my mind at the time i found mary anne to be stunningly attractive the elevator came the doors slid open in the elevator stood the detective wade hawthorne he gaped at them then fumbled inside his coat allen mcclain said being a precog helps you can never be surprised with his heatneedle he shot hawthorne in the head hawthorne crashed back against the far wall of the elevator then fell sloppily and lay sprawled facefirst on the floor of the elevator get in patricia mcclain said to pete he got in and so did the mcclains with the body of wade hawthorne they descended to the ground floor pete said to the rushmore unit of the elevator theyre kidnapping me and theyve killed a detective get help cancel that last request patricia mcclain said to the elevator we dont need any help thank you all right miss the rushmore effect said obediently the elevator doors opened the mcclains followed behind pete through the lobby and out onto the sidewalk to pete patricia mcclain said do you know why hawthorne was in that elevator riding up to your floor ill tell you to arrest you no pete said he told me on the vidphone last night that theyd gotten luckmans murderer a man back east the mcclains glanced at each other but said nothing you killed an innocent man pete said not hawthorne patricia said hardly innocent i wish we could have gotten that eb black at the same time but it wasnt along well maybe later on that damn mary anne allen mcclain said as they got into the car parked at the curb it was not petes car evidently the mcclains had come in it somebody ought to wring her neck he started the car and it spun upward into the morning haze that age is amazing when youre eighteen you believe you know everything you possess absolute certitude and then when youre one hundred and fifty you know you dont you dont even know you dont patricia said you just have a queasy intimation that you dont she sat in the back seat behind pete still holding the heatneedle pointed at him ill make a deal with you pete said i want to be sure carol and the baby are all right whatever you want me to do patricia interrupted youve already made that deal carol and the baby are all right so dont worry about them anyhow the last thing we would want to do is hurt them thats right allen said nodding it would defeat everything we stand for so to speak he smiled at pete how does it feel to have luck you ought to know pete said youve got more children than any other man in california yes allen mcclain agreed but its been over eighteen years since that first time many years indeed you really went out and tied one on last night didnt you mary anne said you were in a trance absolutely blind  pete said nothing gazing down at the ground below he tried to make out the direction of the cars motion it seemed to be heading inland toward the hot central valleyregion of california and the sierras beyond the utterly desolated sierras where no one lived tell us a little more about doctor philipson patricia said to him i catch some illformed thoughts you called him last night after you got home yes to her husband patricia said pete called him up and asked him if hedoctor philipsonwas a vug grinning allen mcclain said what did he say he said that he is not a vug patricia said and then pete called joe schilling and told him the news you know that were entirely surrounded by them and joe schilling suggested he call hawthorne which he did and thats why hawthorne came over this morning ill tell you who you should have called instead of wade hawthorne mcclain said to pete your attorney laird sharp too late now patricia said but well probably run into sharp somewhere along the line anyhow you can talk to him then pete tell him the whole story how were an island of humans swamped in a sea of nonterrestrials she laughed and so did her husband i think were scaring him mcclain said no patricia said im scanning him and hes not scared at least not like he was last night to pete she said that was an ordeal for you wasnt it that trip home with mary anne ill bet you never get over it as long as you live to her husband she said his two frames of reference kept switching back and forth first hed see mary anne as a girl as an attractive eighteenyearold terran and then hed peek over out of the comer of his eye shut up pete said savagely patricia continued and there it would be the amorphous mass of cytoplasm spinning its web of illusion to mix a metaphor poor peter garden it sort of takes the romance out of life doesnt it pete first you couldnt find a bar that would serve mary anne and then stop it her husband said thats really enough hes gone through enough already this rivalry of yours with mary anne its bad for both of you you shouldnt be competing with your own daughter okay pat said and was silent as she lit a cigarette below them the sierras passed slowly pete watched them drop behind better call him patricia said to allen right her husband clicked on the radio transmitter this is dark horse ferry he said into the microphone calling sea green lamb come in sea green lamb come in dave a voice from the radio said this is dave mutreaux im at the dig inn motel in sparks waiting for you okay dave well be right there another five minutes allen mcclain switched his transmitter off all set he said to patricia i can preview it there wont be any gaffs splendid patricia said by the way allen mcclain said to pete mary anrie will be there she came direct in her own car and several other people one of whom you know itll be interesting for you i think theyre all psis mary anne by the way is not a telepath as her mother is despite what she told you that was irresponsible of her a good deal of what she told you was hogwash for instance when she said enough patricia said firmly mcclain shrugged hell know in another half hour i can preview that it just makes me nervous thats all id rather wait until were at the dig inn to pete she said by the way you would have been better off if you had listened to her and kissed her goodnight as she asked you to why pete said then you would have known what she was she added anyhow how many opportunities do you get in your life time to kiss stunninglybeautiful girls her voice as before was bitter youre eating your heart out for nothing allen mcclain told her christ im sorry to see you do it pat pat said and im going to do it again later on with jessica when shes older i know mcclain asid nodding i can preview that even without my talent he looked morose on the flat sand outside the dig inn motel the car landed with the heatneedle the mcclains ushered pete garden out and toward the singlestory spanish style adobe building a longlimbed man welldressed middleaged strode toward them from the motel his hand extended hi mcclain hi pat he glanced at pete mr garden the onetime owner of berkeley california you know garden i dam near came to carmel to play in your group but sorry to say you scared me off with your eeg machine he chuckled im david mutreaux formerly on jerome luckmans staff he held out his hand to pete but pete did not accept it thats right mutreaux drawled you dont understand the situation yet im a little muddled about whats happened and whats shortly to come old age i suppose he led the way up the flagstone path to the open doorway of the motel office mary anne got in a few minutes ago shes taking a swim in the pool hands in her pockets pat walked over to the swimming pool and stood watching her daughter if you could read my mind she said to no one in particular youd see envy she turned away from the pool you know pete when i first met you i lost some of that youre one of the most innocent people ive ever known you helped me purge myself of my shadowside as jungand joe schillingcall it how is joe by the way i enjbyed seeing him again last night howd he feel being awakened at fivethirty in the morning he congratulated me pete said shortly on my luck oh yes mutreaux said in a jolly tone of voice he slapped pete goodnaturedly on the back lots of best wishes on the pregnancy pat said that was an awful remark your exwife made that to carol about hoping it was a baby and that daughter of mine she relished it i suppose she derives that cruel streak from me but dont blame mary anne too much for what she said last night pete because most of what you experienced was not marys fault it was in your mind hallucinated joe schilling was right in what he told you the amphetamines were responsible you had an authentic psychotic occlusion did i pete said she met his gaze yes you did i doubt it pete said lets go inside allen mcclain said he cupped his hands and shouted mary anne get out of the pool splashing the girl approached the rim of the pool go to hell mcclain knelt down we have business get inside youre still my child in the air above the surface of the pool a ball of shiny water formed whipped toward him broke over his head splattering him he jumped back cursing i thought you were such a great precog mary anne called laughing i thought you couldnt be taken by surprise she caught hold of the ladder hoisted herself lithely from the pool the midmorning nevada sun sparkled from her moist smooth body as she ran and picked up a white terry cloth bath towel hello pete garden she said as she ran by him nice to see you again when youre not sick to your stomach you were actually a dark green color like old moldy moss her white teeth glinted as again she laughed allen mcclain brushing drops of water from his face and hair walked over to pete its now eleven oclock he said id like you to call carol and say youre all right however i can look ahead and see you wont or at least probably wont thats right pete said i wont mcclain shrugged well i cant see what shell do possibly shell call the police possibly not time will tell they walked toward the motel building mcclain still shaking him self dry an interesting element about psionic abilities is that some tend to invalidate others for instance my daughters psychokinesis as she aptly demonstrated i cant predict it paulis synchronicity comes in an acausal connective event that throws someone like me entirely off to dave mutreaux patricia said did sid mosk actually confess to having killed luckman yes mutreaux answered rothman put pressure on him to take pressure off pretty blue fox the police out in california were probing a little too deeply we felt but theyll know after a while that its spurious patricia said that vug eb black will get into his mind telepathically it wont matter then mutreaux said i hope inside the motel office an airconditioner roared the room was dark and cool and seated here and there pete saw a number of individuals talking together in muted tones it looked for an instant as if he had stumbled onto a gameplaying group here in the middle of the morning but of course it was not he had no illusions about that these were not bindmen _ he seated himself warily wondering what they were saying some of them sat utterly silent staring straight ahead as if preoccupied telepaths perhaps communicating with one another they seemed to be in the majority the others he could only guess precogs like mcclain psychokinesists like the girl mary anne and rothman whoever he was was rothman here he had a feeling deep and intuitive that rothman was very much here and in control from a side room mary anne appeared now wearing a t shirt and blue cotton shorts and sandals and no bra her breasts were highpointed small she seated herself beside pete vigorously rubbing her hair with a towel to dry it what a bunch of jerks she said quietly to pete i mean dont you agree theymy mother and dadmade me come here she frowned whos that another man had entered the room and looking around him i dont know him probably from the east coast like that mutreaux youre not a vug pete said to her after all no im not i never said i was you asked me what i was and i told you yu can see and you could it was true see peter garden you were an involuntary telepath you were psychotic because of those pills and the drinking and you picked up my marginal thoughts all my anxieties what they used to call the subconscious didnt my mother ever warn you about that she ought to know i see pete said yes she had and before me you picked up that psychiatrists subconscious fears too were all afraid of the vugs its natural theyre our enemies we fought a war with them and didnt win and now theyre here see she dug him in the ribs with her sharp elbow dont look so stupid are you listening or not pete said i am well you gape like a guppy i knew last night you were hallucinating like mad along a paranoid line having to do with hostile menacing conspiracies of alien creatures it interfered with your perceptions but fundamentally you were right i actually was feeling those fears thinking those thoughts psychotics live in a world like that all the time anyhow your interval of being a telepath was unfortunate because it happened around me and i know about this she gestured at the group of people in the motel room see so from then on you were dangerous and you had to go right away and call the police we got you just in time did he believe her he studied her thin heartshaped face he could not tell if telepathic talent it had been it certainly had deserted him now see mary anne said quietly swiftly everyone has the potentiality for psionic talent in severe illness and in deep psychic regression she broke off anyhow peter garden you were psychotic and drunk and on amphetamines and hallucinating but basically you perceived the reality that confronts us the situation this group knows about and is trying to deal with you see she smiled at him her eyes bright now you know he did not see he did not want to see petrified he drew away from her you dont want to know mary anne said thoughtfully  thats right he said but you do know she said already its too late not to she added in her pitiless tone and this time youre not sick and drunk and hallucinating your  perceptions are not distorted so you have to face it headon poor peter garden were you happier last night no he said youre not going to kill yourself about this are you because that wouldnt help you see were an organization pete and you have to join even though youre nonp not a psi well have to take you in anyway or kill you naturally no one wants to kill you what would happen to carol would you leave her for frey a to torment no he said not if i could help it you know the rushmore effect of your car told you i wasnt a vug i dont understand why you didnt listen to it theyre never wrong she sighed not if theyre working properly anyhow havent been tampered with thats how you can always sort out the vugs ask a rushmore see again she smiled at him cheerfully so things arent really so bad its not the end of the world or anything like that we just have a little problem of knowing who our friends are they have the same problem too they get a little mixed up at times who killed luckman pete asked did you no mary anne said the last thing wed do is kill a man whos had so much luck so many offspring thats the whole point she frowned at him but last night he said slowly i asked you if your people had done it and you said he paused trying to think clearly trying to sort out the confusion of those events i know what you said t forget you said andyou said our baby is next you called it a thing you said it was not a baby for a long time mary anne stared at him no she whispered stricken and pale i didnt say that i know i didnt i heard you he insisted i remember that its a mess but honest to god i have that part clear mary anne said then theyve gotten to me her words were scarcely audible he had to bend toward her to hear she continued to stare at him opening the door of the sundrenched kitchen carol holt garden said peteare you in there she peered in he was not in the kitchen bright yellow and warm it was empty going to the window she looked out at the street below petes car and hers at the curb he had not gone in his car then tying the cord of her robe she hurried out of the apartment and down the hall to the elevator ill ask it she decided the elevator will know whether he went out whether anyone was with him and if so who she pressed the button waited the elevator arrived the doors slid back on the floor of the elevator lay a man dead it was hawthorne she screamed the lady said no help was necessary the rushmore circuit of the elevator said apologetically with difficulty carol said what lady the darkhaired lady it did not elaborate did mr garden go with them carol asked they came up without him but returned with him from his apartment mrs garden the man not mr garden killed this person here mr garden then said theyve kidnapped me and theyve killed a detective get help  what did you do the elevator said the darkhaired lady said cancel that last request we dont need any help thank you so i did nothing the elevator was silent a moment did i do wrong it inquired carol whispered very wrong you should have gotten help as he said can i do anything now the elevator asked call the san francisco police department and tell them to send someone here tell them what happened she added that man and woman kidnapped mr garden and you didnt do anything im sorry mrs garden the elevator apologized turning she made her way step by step back to the apartment in the kitchen she seated herself unsteadily at the table those stupid maddening rushmore circuits she thought they  seem so intelligent and they actually arent all it takes is something unusual something unexpected but what did i do not much better i slept while they came and got pete the man and woman it sounds like pat mcclain she thought darkhaired but how do i know the vidphone rang she did not have the energy to answer it trimming his red beard joe schilling sat by his vidphone waiting for an answer strange he thought maybe theyre still asleep its only tenthirty but he did not think so hurriedly he finished trimming his beard he put on his coat and strode from his apartment and downstairs to max his car take me to the gardens apartment he instructed as he slid in up yours the car said its curtains for you if you dont take me there schilling said the car reluctantly started up and drove down the street making the trip the hard way by surface schilling impatiently watched the buildings and maintenance equipment pass one by one until at last they reached san rafael satisfied the car max said as jt pulled to a bucking clumsy halt before the gardens apartment building petes car and carols car were both parked at the curb he noticed as he got out and so were two police cars by elevator he ascended to their floor rushed down the hall the door to the gardens apartment was open he stepped inside a vug met him mr schilling its thoughtpropagation was questioning in tone where are pete and carol he demanded and then he saw past the vug carol garden seated at the kitchen table her face waxen is pete okay he said to her pushing past the vug the vug said i am eb black probably you remember me mr schilling be calm i catch from your thoughts a complete innocence of this so i will not bother to interrogate you raising her head carol said starkly to schilling wade hawthorne the detective has been murdered and petes gone a man and woman came and got him according to the elevator they killed hawthorne i think it was pat mcclain the police checked at her apartment and nobodys there and their car is gone butdo you know why they would take pete schilling asked her no i dont know why they would take pete i dont even know who they are really with a pseudopodium the vug eb black held something small it extended it toward joe schilling mr garden wrote this interesting inscription the vug said  we are entirely surrounded by vugs that however is not so as mr gardens disappearance testifies to last night mr garden called my excolleague mr hawthorne and told him that he knew who had killed mr luckman at that time we imagined we had the killer and so we were not interested now we have learned we were in error mr garden did not say who had killed mr luckman unfortunately because my excolleague refused to listen the vug was silent a moment mr hawthorne has paid for his foolishness rather fully carol said eb black thinks that whoever killed luckman came and got pete and ran into hawthorne in the elevator on their way out but it doesnt know who that is schilling said correct eb black said from mrs garden i have managed to learn a great deal however for instance i have learned whom mr garden saw last night a psychiatrist in pocatello idaho first of all also mary anne mcclain we have not been able to locate her however mr garden was drunk and confused he told mrs garden that the murder of mr luckman had been committed by six members of pretty blue fox the six with defective memories this would include himself do you have any comment on that mr schilling no joe schilling murmured we hope to get back mr garden alive eb black said it did not sound very confident chapter 12 patricia mcclain picked up her daughters frightened thoughts at once she said rothman weve been infiltrated mary anne says so jts she right rothman old hardeyed and tough demanded from where he as their leader sat looking into pete gardens mind patricia saw his memory of the visit to doctor er philipson the strange sense of lightness of fractional gravity as he walked down the corridor yes patricia said marys right hes been on titan she turned to the two precogs dave mutreaux and her husband allen whats going to happen a variable allen murmured ashenfaced clouds it up mutreaux said hoarsely your daughter shes going to do something impossible for us to tell what i have to get out of here mary anne said to them all she rose to her feet her thoughts scattered by her terror im under vug influence that doctor philipson pete must have been right he asked me what i saw in the bar and i thought he was hallucinating but it wasnt my fear he was picking up he saw reality she started toward the door of the motel room panting i have to get away im dangerous to the organization as mary anne went out the door patricia said urgently to her husband the heatneedle set it on low so it doesnt injure her ill cut her down allen said and pointed the heatneedle at his daughters back mary anne turned for an instant and saw the heatneedle the heatneedle jumped from allen mcclains hand climbed and reversed its flight it smashed against the wall poltergeist effect allen said we cant stop her now the heatneedle in patricias hands quivered struggled and tore loose from her fingers rothman he said appealing to the highest authority in the organization present ask her to stop leave my mind alone mary anne said to rothman pete garden on his feet sprinted after mary anne the girl saw that too no patricia called after her dont rothman his forehead bulging concentrated on mary anne his eyes virtually shut but all at once pete garden flopped forward like a rag doll boneless danced in the air his limbs jiggling he drifted then toward the wall of the motel room and patricia mcclain screamed at mary anne the dangling figure hesitated briefly and then swooped into the wall it passed through the wall until only its outstretched arm and hand remained projecting absurdly mary anne patricia shouted for gods sake bring him back at the door mary anne halted turned in panic saw what she had done with pete garden saw the expression on her mothers face and on allens face the horror of everyone in the room rothman focussing everything which he possessed on her was trying to persuade her she saw that too and thank god allen mcclain said and sagged from the wall pete garden tumbled back out fell in a heap on the floor intact he got up almost at once and stood shaking facing mary anne im sorry mary anne said and sighed rothman said we hold the dominant possibility here mary anne believe that even if they have gotten in well examine everyone in the organization person by person shall we start with you to patricia he said try and find out for me just how deeply theyve penetrated her im trying patricia said but its in pete gardens mind that well find the most hes going to leave allen and dave mutreaux said almost at once with her with mary anne mutreaux said she cant be predicted but i think hes going to make it rothman rose to his feet and walked toward pete garden you see our situation were in a desperate match with the titanians and losing ground to them steadily prevail on mary anne mcclain to stay here so we can regain what weve lost we have to or were doomed i cant make her do anything pete said white and trembling almost unable to speak nobody can patricia said and allen nodded you pks rothman said to mary anne so willful and stubborn nobody can tell you anything come on pete mary anne said to him we have to get a long way from here because of me and because of you too theyre into you just as they are in me her face was drawn with despair and fatigue pete said to her maybe theyre right mary anne maybe it would be wrong to go wouldnt that split up your organization they dont really want me mary anne said im weak this proves it i cant stand up against the vugs the damn vugs i hate them tears filled her eyes tears of impotence the precog dave mutreaux said garden i can preview one thing if you do leave here alone or with mary anne mcclain your car will be intercepted by the police i foresee a vug detective moving toward you its name is mutreaux hesitated eb black allen mcclain also precog agreed finishing for him wade hawthornes partner attached to the west coast division of the national lawenforcement agency one of the best they have he said to mutreaux and rothman nodded lets do this carefully rothman said at what point in time did the vug authority penetrate our organization last night previous to last night if we could establish that maybe wed have something to go on i dont think theyve gotten very deep they havent reached me havent reached any of our telepaths and we have four of them in this room and a fifth on the way here and our precogs are free at least so it would seem mary anne said youre trying to probe into me and influence me rothman but she returned slowly to where she had been sitting i can feel your mindat work she smiled a little its reassuring to pete garden rothman said im the main bulwark against the vugs mr garden and itll be a long time before they penetrate me his leather like face was impassive this is a dreadful discovery weve made here today but our organization can surmount it what about you garden youre going to need our help for an individual its different somberly pete nodded we must kill eb black patricia said yes dave mutreaux said i agree rothman said go easily here weve never killed a vug killing hawthorne was bad enough sufficiently dangerous but necessary as soon as we destroy a vugany vugitll become clear to them not only that we exist but what our final intentions are isnt that so he looked around at the organization for confirmation but allen mcclain said they obviously know about us already they could hardly penetrate us without knowing of our existence his voice was sharp edged with exasperation the telepath merle smith spoke up from her seat in the corner she had taken no part in the colloquy so far rothman i have been scanning each person here in the motel and i find no indication that anyone has been penetrated in addition to mary anne mcclain and the nonp garden whom she wanted brought here although there is a peculiar inert area in david mutreaux mind which should be looked into i wish you other telepaths would do that right now at once patricia turned her attention on dave mutreaux merle she discovered was correct there was an anomaly in mutreaux mind and she felt at once that it implied a situation unfavorable to the interests of the organization mutreaux she said can you turn your thoughts to it was difficult to know what to call it she had in her hundred years of scanning never run into anything quite like it puzzled she passed over mutreaux surface thoughts and probed into the deeper levels of his psyche into the involuntary and repressed syndromes which had been excluded as part of his egocharacter of the conscious selfsystem now she was in a region of ambivalent drives and of nebulous and stillborn wishes anxieties doubts interwoven with regressive beliefs and libido wishes of a fantastic nature it was not a pleasant region but each person had it she was accustomed to it by now this was what made her existence so rife with difficulty running into this hostile area of the human mind each perception and observation which dave mutreaux had rejected in himself existed here imperishable living on in a kind of halflife feeding deeply on his psychic energy he could not be held responsible for these and yet there they were anyhow semiautonomous andferal opposed to everything mutreaux consciously deliberately believed in in opposition to all his life aims much could be learned about mutreaux psyche by this examination of what he chose toor had toreject from consciousness the area in question patricia said simply will not open up to scanning can you control it dave mutreaux said haltingly a bewildered expression on his face i dont understand whats being discussed everything in me is open to you as far as i know im certainly not deliberately holding back now she had picked up the precognitive region of mutreaux mind and by entering it she made herself temporarily a precog it was an eerie sensation to possess this talent as well as her customary one she saw as if arranged in neat boxes a supple viable sequence of timepossibilities each one obviating all the others strung so as to be knowable simultaneously it was pictorial and oddly static rather than dramatic patricia saw herself frozen in a variety of actions some she blanched atthey were hideous sequences in which she yielded to her most deranged suspicions and my own daughter she thought bleakly so its possible that i might do that to her possible but not probable the majority of sequences showed a rapprochement with mary anne and a healing of the split within the organization rather than a widening and yetit could happen and in addition she saw in one swift instant a scene in which the telepaths within the organization pounced on mutreaux and mutreaux himself certainly was aware of this the scene after all existed in his consciousness but why patricia wondered what could he do that would warrant this or what could we discover mutreaux thoughts became diffused all at once youre evading patricia said and glanced at merle and then at the other telepaths in the room its the arrival of don she said to them don was the missing telepath on his way now from detroit he would arrive any time in mutreaux precog area theres a sequence in which don will on his arrival here ferret out the inert area involved will open and explore it and she hesitated but the three other telepaths had picked up her thought anyhow and will destroy mutreaux because of it she had thought but why there was nothing to suggest the vuggish power about it or about him this was something else and it completely baffled her was it certain that don would do this no only probable and how did mutreaux feel knowing this knowing that his death was imminent what did a precog do under such circumstancesp the same as anyone else she discovered as she scanned mutreaux mind the precog ran mutreaux rising to his feet said huskily ive got to get back to the new york area im afraid his manner was easy but inside the opposite sorry i cant stay he said to rothman don is our best telepath rothman said meditatively im going to have to ask you to remain until he gets here our only defense against the penetration of our organization is the existence of four telepaths who can dig in and tell us whats going on so you must sit down mutreaux mutreaux reseated himself closing his eyes pete garden listened to the discussion between patricia mcclain mutreaux and rothman this secret organization composed of psipeople stands between us and the titanian civilization its domination over us or some such thing his thoughts ran together muddily he still had not recovered from last night and the manner in which he had been awakened this morningthat and hawthornes pointless shocking death i wonder if carols all right pete thought god he thought i wish i could get out of here he thought of the moment when mary anne through her psychokinetic talent had made him a floating particle had tossed him into and through the material wall of the room and then somehow for reasons unclear to him had let him come back she had changed her mind at the last instant im afraid of these people he said to himself of them and their talents he opened his eyes in the motel room discoursing in shrill chattery voices sat nine vugs and one human being besides himself dave mutreaux he and dave mutreaux standing in opposition to the rest of them hopeless and impossible he did not stir he simply stared at the nine vugs one vugit spoke in the voice of patricia mcclainsaid agitatedly rothman ive picked up an incredible thought from garden i have too another vug said in agreement garden perceives us all as it heistated he sees us with the exception of mutreaux as vugs there was silence the vug which spoke as rothman said garden this implies then that the penetration of our group is complete is that right complete with the exception of david mutreaux at least pete said nothing how can we consider this the vug calling itself rothman said and keep on being sane weve already lost if gardens perceptions are to be believed we must try to consider rationally possibly theres some hope what do you say mutreaux if garden is right youre the only authentic terran among us mutreaux said i have no understanding of this he glanced at pete ask him not me well mr garden the vug rothman said calmly what do you say please answer the patricia mcclain one pleaded pete in the name of all we hold holy pete said i think you know now what there is in mutreaux that your telepaths couldnt scan hes a human being and youre not thats the difference and when your last telepath gets here well destroy mutreaux the rothman vug said slowly thoughtfully chapter 13 joseph schilling said to the homeostatic informational circuit of the vidphone i want the attorneyatlaw laird sharp hes somewhere on the west coast i dont know any more than that it was past noon now pete garden had not returned home and joe schilling knew that he was not going to there was no point in contacting the other members of pretty blue fox pete wasnt with any of them whoever had taken him lay outside the group if this identity problem has actually already been solved he thought if pat and a1 mcclain did it then why and killing the detective hawthorne a mistake whatever their reasons no one could convince him of the rightness of such an action as that going into the bedroom of the apartment he asked carol how are you feeling she sat by the window wearing a gailycolored cotton print dress listlessly watching the street below im okay joe the detective eb black had temporarily gone out of the apartment so joe schilling shut the bedroom door and said to carol i know something about the mcclains that the police arent to know raising her eyes carol regarded him tell me joe schilling said shes mixed up in some kind of extralegal activity has been apparently for some time that would fit in with the murder of hawthorne ill make a guess i think its connected with her being a psi and her husband too but other than that and it isnt much i cant account for them murdering especially a police detective now look what theyve got on their hands a nationwide search by all police agencies they must be desperate or fanatic he thought to himself theres no one the police hate more than a copkiller he murmured it was a stupid thing to do fanatic and stupid he thought a bad mixture the vidphone rang and said your party mr schilling the attorney laird sharp schilling at once snapped the screen on laird he said good whats happened sharp said your clients gone pete garden he explained tersely what had happened and i have an intuitive distrust of the police schilling said for some reason it seems to me theyre not trying maybe its because of the vug eb black the instinctive aversion of the terran was there operating within himself he realized sharp said um lets make a run up to pocatello what did you say the psychiatrists name is philipson joe schilling said hes worldfamous what do you expect to find up there i dont know sharp said after all im getting everything thirdhand but i have a hunch ill fly to san rafael and meet you there stay put for another ten minutes im in san francisco right schilling said and broke the connection where are you going carol asked him as he started for the door of the apartment you told petes attorney youd meet him here im going to get a gun schilling said he shut the door after him and hurried down the hall i only need one he realized because if i know laird sharp hes carrying his own at all times as he and sharp flew northeast in sharps car schilling said on the vid last night pete said some strange things first that this situation was going to kill pete as it had killed luckman that he should be especially careful of carols safety and he glanced at sharp pete said that doctor philipson is a vug so sharp said there are vugs all over the planet but i know something about philipson joe schilling said ive read his articles and read about his therapeutic techniques theres never been any mention of him being a titanian somethings wrong i dont think pete saw doctor philipson i think he saw someone or something else a man of philipsons stature wouldnt be available in the middle of the night like a common gp and where did pete get the one hundred and fifty dollars he remembers paying philipson i know pete he never carries money on him no bindman does they think in terms of real estate deeds not cash money is for us nonbs did he actually say he had paid this doctor possibly he simply ran up a bill for that amount pete said that he had paid him and paid him last night and he said hed gotten his moneys worth joe schilling brooded about it for a moment in petes condition drunk and drugstimulated and in a manic phase because of carols pregnancy he wouldnt have known what he really saw if it actually was philipson or not that sat facing him and its always possible that he hallucinated the entire episode that he never went to pocatello at all he got out his pipe and his pouch of tobacco the whole episode doesnt ring right pete may be one sick cookie that may be the root of the whole problem what do you use in your pipe these days sharp asked still nothing but white burley roughcut not any more this is a mixture called barking dog it never bites sharp grinned briefly at the outskirts of pocatello doctor philipsons psychiatric clinic lay below a square of dazzling white surrounded by lawns and trees and in the rear a rose garden sharp landed his car on the gravel driveway and continued by surface up into the parking lot at the side of the large central building the place quiet and welltended seemed deserted the only car in the parking lot appeared to be doctor philipsons own peaceful schilling thought but obviously its enormously expensive to come here the rose garden attracted him and he meandered toward it sniffing the air and smelling the deep heavy scent of roses and organic fertilizers a sprinkler homeostatic and efficient rotated as it watered a lawn causing him to step from the path and onto the thick springy grass itself just being here would cure me he thought getting the smells feeling the textures of the pastoral community ahead he saw tied to a post a nodding gray donkey look he said to laird sharp who had followed behind him two of the finest roses ever developed peace and star of holland in the twentieth century they were rated something like nine points in rosegrowing circles he explained nine was extremely good and then of course they developed the more modem patented rose space voyager he pointed to it the huge orange and white buds and our land that was a red so dark as to be virtually black with spatters of lighter dots across the petals while they were inspecting our land the door of the clinic building flew open and a bald friendlylooking elderly man stepped out smiling at them in greeting can i help you he asked eyes twinkling sharp said were looking for doctor philipson thats i the elderly man said im afraid the rose garden needs spraying i see grefi on several bushes he brushed at a leaf with the side of his hand grefi a mite that slipped in here from mars joe schilling said where can we go that we could talk to you right here doctor philipson said did a mr peter garden visit you late last nigit schilling asked he certainly did doctor philipson smiled wryly and vidphoned me even later pete garden has been kidnapped schilling said his abductors killed a policeman on the way so they must be serious the smile on doctor philipsons face vanished that so he glanced at schilling and then at laird sharp i was worried about something on this order first jerome luckmans death now followed by this come in he held the door to the clinic building open then abruptly changed his mind perhaps it would be better if we sat in the car so no one overhears he led the way back to the parking lot there are several matters id like to discuss with you presently the three of them were seated tensely in doctor philipsons car whats your relationship to peter garden the doctor asked schilling briefly told him probably philipson said youll never see garden alive again im deeply sorry to say that but its almost certainly the truth i tried to warn him i know that schilling said he told me i knew too little about pete garden the doctor said id never seen him before in my life i couldnt get an accurate background history from him because last night he was drunk and sick and scared he phoned me at my home i had gone to bed i met him in downtown pocatello at a bar i forget the name of it now it was a bar at which he had stopped he had an attractive young girl with him but she didnt come in garden was actively hallucinating and needed major psychiatric help i could scarcely supply that to him in the middle of the night at a bar needless to say his fear joe schilling said was of the vugs pete believed they wereclosing in on us yes i realize that he expressed those fears last night to me a number of times in a variety of ways it was touching at one point he very laboriously scratched himself a message on a match folder and hid itwith great ceremonyin his shoe the vugs are after us it said or words to that effect the doctor eyed schilling and laird sharp what do you know at this moment about the internal problems on titan taken by surprise joe schilling said not a damn thing doctor philipson said titan civilization is sharply divided into two factions the reason i know this is simple i have in the clinic here several titanians who hold high posts here on earth theyre undergoing psychiatric treatment with me its somewhat unorthodox but i discover i can work with them well enough alertly sharp said is that why you wanted to talk here in the car yes philipson said here were out of range of their telepathic ability all four of them are moderates politicallyspeaking thats the dominant force in titan politics and has been for decades but there is also a war party a faction of extremists their power has been growing but no one in eluding the titanians themselves seems to know precisely how strong theyve become in any case their policy toward terra is hostile i have a theory i cant prove this but ive hinted at it in several papers ive done he paused i thinkjust think mind youthat the titanians on the instigation of their war party elements are tinkering with our birth rate on some technological leveldont ask me quite how theyre responsible for holding our birth rate down there was silence a long strained one as far as luckman goes doctor philipson said id guess that he was killed either directly or indirectly by titanians but not for the reason you think true he had just come out to california after sewing up the east coast thoroughly true he probably would have assumed economic domination of california as he did with new york but that was not why the titanians killed him it was because they had been trying to get to him probably for months possibly even years when luckman left the sanctuary of his organization and came out to carmel where he had no precogs no human psipeople to protect him whyd they kill him sharp asked quietly because of his luck the doctor replied his fertility his ability to have children thats what menaces the titanians not his success at the game they dont give a god damn about that i see sharp said and any other human who has luck stands to be wiped out if the war party has its way now listen some humans know this or suspect this theres an organization based on the prolific mcclains of california perhaps youve heard of them patricia and allen mcclain they have three children therefore their lives are acutely in danger pete garden has demonstrated the ability to be fertile and that puts him and his pregnant wife also in automatic jeopardy and i jp warned him and i warned him that he was facing a situation about which he could do little i firmly believe that and doctor philipsons voice was steady i think the organization formed around the mcclains is futile if not dangerous it has probably already been penetrated by the titanian authority here which is quite effective at that sort of business their telepathic faculty works to their advantage its almost impossible to keep anythingsuch as the existence of a secret militant patriotic organizationsecret from them for long schilling said are you in touch with the moderates through your vug patients here hesitating doctor philipson said to some extent in the most general way ive discussed the situation with them its come up during therapy schilling said to laird sharp i think weve found out what we came for we know where pete is who kidnapped him and killed hawthorne the mcclain organization whatever its called wherever it is with an expression of keen wariness laird sharp said doctor your explanation is extremely interesting theres another interesting matter however that has not as yet been raised oh doctor philipson said sharp said pete garden thought you were a vug i realize that doctor philipson said to some extent i can explain that on an unconscious intuitive level garden perceived the dangerous situation his perceptions however were disordered a mixture of involuntary telepathy and projection his own anxiety plus are you a vug laird sharp asked of course not doctor philipson said brusquely to the rushmore effect of the car in which they were seated laird sharp said is doctor philipson a vug doctor philipson is a vug the autoauto mech replied that is correct and it was doctor philipsons own car doctor joe schilling said do you have any reaction to that he held his gun an ancient but efficient 32 revolver pointed at doctor philipson id like your comment please obviously its a false statement by the circuit doctor philipson said but i admit there is more i havent told you the organization of psipersons around the mcclains im a part of that youre a psi schilling said correct doctor phifipson said nodding and the girl with pete garden last night is also a member mary anne mcclain she and i conferred briefly as to policy regarding garden it was she who arranged for me to see garden at such a late hour at night i normally what is your psionic talent sharp said breaking in now he also held a gun pointed at the doctor it was a small 22 pistol doctor philipson glanced at him and then at joseph schilling he said an unusual one it will surprise you when i tell you basically its related to mary annes a form of psychokinesis but it is rather specialized compared with hers i form one end of a twoway underground system between terra and titan titanians come here and on occasion certain terrans are transmitted to titan this procedure is an improvement on the standard spacecraft method because there is no time lapse he smiled at joe schilling and laird sharp may i show you he leaned forward my god sharp said kill him do you see doctor philipsons voice came to them but they could not make him out an extinguishing curtain had blotted the fixed images of the objects around them had blotted them into waste junk like a billion golf balls cascaded brightly replacing the familiar reality of substantial forms it was joe schilling thought like a fundamental breakdown of the act of perception itself in spite of himself his determination he felt fear ill shoot him laird sharps voice came and then the racket of a gun fired several times in quick succession did i get him joe did i sharps voice faded now there was only silence joe schilling said im scared sharp what is this he did not understand and he reached out groping in the stream of atomlike subparticles that surged everywhere is this the understructure of the universe itself he wondered the world outside of space and time beyond the modes of cognition he saw now a great plain on which vugs unmoving rested at fixed spaces or was it that they moved incredibly slowly there was an anguish to their situation the vugs strained but the category of time did not move and the vugs remained where they were is it forever joe schilling wondered there were many of the vugs he could not see the termination of the horizontal surface could not even imagine it this is titan a voice said inside his head weightless joe schilling drifted down wanting desperately to stabilize himself but not knowing how dammit he thought this is all wrong i shouldnt be here doing this help he said aloud get me out of this are you there some place laird sharp whats happening to us no one answered more rapidly now he fell nothing stopped him in the usual sense and yet all at once he was there he experienced it around him formed the hollowness of a chamber a vast enclosure of some nebulous sort and across from him facing him across a table were vugs he counted twenty of them and then gave up the vugs were everywhere in front of him silent and motionless but somehow doing something they were ceaselessly busy and at first he could not imagine what they were doing and then all at once he understood play the vugs thoughtpropagated the board was so enormous that it petrified him its sides its two ends faded disappeared into the understructure of the reality in which he sat and yet directly before him he made out cards clearcut and separable the vugs waited he was supposed to draw a card it was his turn thank god joe schilling said to himself that im able to play that i know how it would not matter to them if i didnt this game has been going on too long for that to matter how long no knowing perhaps the vugs themselves did not know or remember  the card he drew read twelve and now he thought the sequence which is the heart of the game the moment in which i bluff or do not bluff in which i advance my piece either twelve or nulltwelve but they can read my thoughts he realized how can i play the game with them then its not fair and yet he had to play anyhow thats the situation were in he said to himself and we cant extricate ourselves any of us and even great gameplayers such as jerome luckman can die at it die trying to succeed we have been waiting a long time for you a vug thoughtpropagated to him please dont keep us waiting any longer he did not know what to do and what was the stake what deed had he put up he looked around but he saw nothing no pot or hopper a bluffing game in which telepaths participate for stakes which do not exist joe schilling realized what a travesty how can i get out of this is there a way out he did not even know that much this the platonic ultimate template of the game a reproduction of which had been impressed on terra for terrans to play he understood and yet it did not help him to understand because he still could not get out of it he picked up his piece and began to advance it square by square twelve squares ahead he read the inscription gold rush on your land you win 50000000 in royalties from two producing mines no need to bluff joe schilling said to himself what a square the best he had ever heard of no such square existed on the boards of earth he placed his piece on that square and sat back would anyone challenge him accuse him of bluffing he waited there was no motion no indication of life from the nearinfinite row of vugs well he thought im ready go ahead it is a bluff a voice declared he could not make out which vug had challenged him they seemed to have expressed themselves in unison had their telepathic ability become faulty at this critical moment he wondered or had the talent been deliberately suspended for purposes of playing the game youre wrong he said and turned over his card here it is he glanced down it was no longer a twelve it was an eleven you are a had bluffer mr schilling the corporate group of vugs thought is this how you generally play im under tension joe schilling said i misread the card he was furious and badly frightened theres some kind of cheating going on he said anyhow whats the stakes in this the vugs answered in this game detroit i dont see the deed joe schilling said looking up and down the table look again the vugs said in the center of the table he saw what appeared to be a glass ball the size of a paperweight something complex and shiny and alive flickered within the globe and he bent to scrutinize it a city in miniature buildings and streets houses factories    it was detroit we want that next the vugs told him reaching out joe schilling moved his piece back one square i really lauded on that he said the game exploded i cheated joe schilling said now its impossible to play do you grant that ive wrecked the game something hit him over the head and he fell dropped instantly into the engulfing grayness of unconsciousness chapter 14 the next he knew joseph schilling stood on a desert and feeling the reassuring tug of terras gravity once more the sun blinding him spilled down in goldhot familiar tor rents and he squinted trying to see holding up his hand to ward off its rays dont stop a voice said he opened his eyes and saw walking beside him across the uneven sand doctor philipson the elderly sprightly little doctor was smiling keep moving doctor philipson said in a pleasant conventional tone of voice or well die out here and you wouldnt like that explain it to me joe schilling said but he kept on walking doctor philipson remained beside him walking with easy long strides you certainly broke up the game doctor philipson chuckled it never occurred to them that youd cheat they cheated first they changed the value of the card to them thats legitimate a basic move in the game its a favorite play by the titanian gameplayers to exert their extrasensory faculties on the card its supposed to be a contest between the sides the one whos drawn the card struggles to keep its value constant you see by yielding to the altered value you lost but by moving your piece in conformity to it you thwarted them what happened to the stake detroit doctor philipson laughed it remains a stake unclaimed you see the titanian gameplayers believe in following the rules you may not believe that but its true their rules yes but rules nonetheless now i dont know what theyll do theyve been waiting to play against you in particular for a long time but im sure they wont try again after what just happened it must have been psychically unnerving for them itll be a great while before they recover what faction do they represent the extremists oh no the titanian gameplayers are exceptionally moderate in their political thinking what about you schilling said doctor philipson said i admit to being an extremist thats why im here on terra in the blinding midday sunlight his heatneedle sparkled as it rose and fell with his long strides were almost there mr schilling one more hill and youll see it its built low to the ground attracts little attention are all the vugs here on earth extremists no doctor philipson said what about eb black the detective doctor philipson said nothing not of your party schilling decided there was no answer philipson was not going to say i should have trusted it when i had the chance schilling said perhaps so doctor philipson said nodding ahead schilling saw a spanishstyle building with tile roof and pale adobe walls contained by an ornamental railing of black iron the dig inn motel the neon signturned off and inertread is laird sharp here schilling asked sharp is on titan doctor philipson said perhaps i will bring him back but certainly not at this time doctor philipson briefly scowled an agilebrained creature that sharp i must admit i dont care for him with a white linen handkerchief he mopped his red and perspiring forehead slowing down a little now as they came up onto the flagstone path of the motel and as for your cheating i didnt much care for that either he seemed tense and irritable now schilling wondered why the door of the motel office was open and doctor philipson went toward it peering into the darkness within rothman he said in a hesitant questioning voice a figure appeared a woman it was patricia mcclain sorry im late doctor philipson began but this man here and a companion showed up at the patricia mcclain said shes out of control allen couldnt help get away she ran past doctor philipson and joe schilling across the parking lot toward a car parked there then all at once she was gone doctor philipson grunted cursed stepped back from the motel door as swiftly as if he had been seared high in the midday sky joe schilling saw a dot rising and then disappearing toward invisibility on and on it rushed away from earth away from the ground until finally he could no longer see it his head ached from the glare and the effort of seeing and he turned to doctor philipson my god was that he started to say look doctor philipson said he pointed with his heatneedle at the motel office and joe schilling looked inside he could not see at first and then by degree his eyes accustomed themselves to the gloom on the floor lay twisted bodies of men and women tangled together like multiarmed monsters as if they had been shaken and then dropped there discarded the remains jammed together forced into an impossible fusion mary anne mcclain sat on the floor in the corner curled up her face buried in her hands pete garden and a welldressed middleaged man whom schilling did not know stood together silently their faces blank rothman doctor philipson choked staring at one of the shattered bodies he turned toward pete garden when he said she just now did it pete garden murmured youre lucky the welldressed middleaged man said to doctor philipson if you had been here she would have killed you too youre fortunate you missed your appointment doctor philipson shaking lifted his heatneedle and pointed it unsteadily at mary anne mcclain dont pete garden said they tried that at the end mutreaux doctor philipson said why didnt she hes a terran pete garden said the only one of you who was so she didnt touch him the best thing the welldressed man mutreaux said is for none ofus to do anything move as little as possible thats the safest he kept his eyes fixed on the huddled shape of mary anne mcclain she didnt even miss her father mutreaux said but patricia got away i dont know what happened to her the girl got her too doctor philipson said we watched we didnt understand then he tossed the heatneedle away it rolled across the floor and came to rest against the far wall his face was gray does she understand what shes done pete garden said she knows she understands the dangerousness of her talent and she doesnt want to use it again to joe schilling he said they couldnt seem to manage her they had partial control but it kept slipping away i watched the struggle its been going on here in this room for the last few horns even when their last member came he pointed to a squashed crumpled body a man with glasses and light hair don they called him they thought hed turn the tide but mutreaux threw his talent in with hers it all happened in a second one minute they were sitting in their chairs the next she just simply began flinging them around like rag dolls he added it wasnt pleasant but he shrugged anyhow thats what happened doctor philipson said a dreadful loss he glanced at mary anne with hatred poltergeist he said unmanageable we knew but because of patricia and allen we accepted her as she was well well have to begin all over again from the start of course i have nothing personally to fear from her i can return to my primary nexus titan whenever i wish presumably her talent doesnt extend that far and if it does theres not much we can do ill take the chance i have to i think she can freeze you here if she wants to mutreaux said mary anne he said sharply in the corner the girl raised her head her cheeks joe schilling saw were tearstained do you have any objection if this last one returns to titan i dont know she said listlessly joe schilling said theyve got sharp there i see mutreaux said well that makes a difference to mary anne he said dont let philipson go all right she murmured nodding doctor philipson shrugged a good point well its agreeable to me sharp can return here ill go to titan his tone was calm but schilling saw the mans eyes were opaque with shock and tension arrange for it now mutreaux said of course doctor philipson said i dont want to be around this girl that must be obvious even to you and i can hardly say i envy you and your people depending on a crude erratic power of this sort its apt to rebound or be turned deliberately against you any moment he added sharp is now back from titan at my clinic in idaho can that be verified mutreaux said to joe schilling place a call to your car there doctor philipson said he should be in it or close by it by now going outdoors joe schilling found a parked car whose are you he asked it opening its door mr and mrs mcclains the rushmore effect stated i want to use your vidphone seated within the sunscorched interior of the car joe schilling placed a call to his own car at doctor philipsons clinic in the outskirts of pocatello idaho what the hell do you want now the voice of max his car answered after a wait is laird sharp there joe schilling asked who cares listen schilling began but all at once laird sharps features formed on the small vidscreen youre okay schilling asked him sharp curtly nodded did you see the titanian gameplayers joe how many were there i couldnt seem to count them i not only saw them i conned them joe schilling said so they right away bumped me back here take max you know my carand fly back to san francisco ill meet you there to the old sullen car he said max you cooperate with laird sharp goddam it all right max said irritably im cooperating joe schilling returned to the motel room i previewed your narration about the attorney mutreaux said we let philipson go schilling looked around it was so there was no sign of doctor eg philipson its not over pete garden said philipson is back on titan hawthorne is dead but their organization mutreaux said its abolished mary anne and i are the only ones remaining i couldnt believe it when i saw her destroy rothman he was the pivot of the organizations power he now bent down beside rothmans body touching it whats the wisest thing to do now joe schilling said to pete we cant pursue them to titan can we he did not want to face the gameplayers of titan again and yet pete said wed better bring in eb black its the only thing i can think of at this point that might help otherwise were finished we can trust black can we mutreaux said schilling said doctor philipson implied that we could he hesitated yes i vote we take the chance so do i pete said and mutreaux after a pause brusquely nodded what about you mary pete turned jo the girl who still sat curled up in a rigid stricken ball i dont know she said finally i dont know who to believe in or trust any more i dont even know about myself its got to be done joe schilling said to pete in my opinion anyhow he or it is looking for you hes with carol if hes not reliable schilling broke off and scowled then hes got carol pete agreed stonily yes schilling nodded pete said call him from here together they went outside to the mcclains parked car joe schilling placed the call to the apartment in san rafael if were making a mistake joe schilling thought it probably means carols death and the death of their baby i wonder which it is he asked himself a boy or a girl they have those tests now they can tell after the third week pete of course would accept either he smiled a little pete said tensely ive got him on the screen the image of a vug formed and joe schilling reflected that it looked to him at leastlike any other vug this is what doctor philipson really looks like he knew what pete saw and he thought he was hallucinating where are you mr garden the vugs query came to them from the speaker i see you have mr schilling there with you what do you require from the coast police author ity we are ready to dispatch a ship when and where you tell us were coming back pete siad we dont need any ship how is carol mrs garden is anxiously concerned but physically in satisfactory condition there are nine dead vugs here jpe schilling said eb black said instantly of the wa pei nan the extremist party yes schilling said one returned to titan he had been here as doctor eg philipson of pocatello idaho you know the wellknown psychiatrist we urge you to take his clinic at once there could be others entrenched there we will shortly do that eb black promised are the killers of my colleage wade hawthorne among the dead yes joe schilling said a relief eb black said give us your location and we will send someone out to undertake whatever dispositionary chores are necessary pete gave him the information thats that schilling said as the screen faded he did not know how to feel had they done the right thing we will know before very long he said to himself together they walked back to the motel room neither of them saying anything if they get us pete said pausing at the door of the room i still say we did the best we could you cant know everything this is all he gestured blurred and twisting people and things merging back and forth into each other maybe i havent recovered from last night joe schilling said pete i saw the gameplayers of titan it was enough what should we do pete said get pretty blue fox back into being and then what joe schilling said play against the titanian gameplayers joe schilling said we have to theyre not going to give us any choice together they reentered the motel room as they flew back to san francisco mary anne said faintly i dont feel their control over me as strongly as i did its waned mutreaux glanced at her lets hope so he looked utterly tired i preview he said to pete garden your effects to get your group restored want to know the outcome yes pete said the police will grant it by tonight youll be a legal gameplaying body again as before you will meet at your condominium apartment in carmel and plan your strategy at this point there is a division into parallel futures they hinge in a disputed fact whether your group permits you to bring mary anne mcclain in as a new gameplaying bindman what are the two futures branching from that pete asked i can see the one without her very clearly lets simply say its not good the otherits blurred because mary is a variable and cant be previewed within causal frameworks she introduces the acausal principle of synchronicity mutreaux was silent a moment i think on the basis of what i preview i would advise you to make the attempt to bring her into the group even though its illegal thats right joe schilling said nodding its strictly against the bylaws of bluffplaying entities no psi of any description can be admitted but our antagonists arent nonpsi humans theyre titans and telepaths i see her value with her in our group the telepath factor is balanced otherwise they hold an absolute advantage he recalled the alteration in the card which he had drawn its change from twelve to eleven we couldnt win against that he realized and even with mary i should be admitted too if possible mutreaux said although again legally im also inadmissable pretty blue fox must be made to comprehend the issues involved what the stakes are this time its not just an exchange of property deeds not a competition among bindmen to see whos top man its our old struggle with an enemy renewed after all these years if it ever ceased in the first place it never did cease mary anne spoke up we knew that the people in our organization whether we were vugs or terrans we agreed on that what can you see us obtaining from eb black and the police power pete asked mutreaux i preview a meeting between the area commissioner us cummings and eb black but i cant seem to foresee the outcome there is something which us cummings is involved in that introduces another variable i wonder us cummings may be an extremist what is it called the wa pei nan joe schilling said thats what eb black called it he had never heard the words before the vug detective had said them he rolled them around in his mind trying to get the flavor of them but they were impenetrable shut tight to him he gave up he could not imagine what such a party was like or how it felt to belong to it i cant empathize with them he realized and thats bad because if we cant put ourselves in their places we cant predict what theyre going to do even with the use of our precog he did not feel very confident however he did not tell that to the people in the car with him soon he thought wethe augmented gameplaying group pretty blue foxwill make our first move against the titanians well have perhaps the help of mutreaux and mary anne mcclain will that be enough mutreaux cant see and no one can count on mary anne as doctor philipson pointed out and yet he was glad they had her without mary anne he thought caustically pete and i would be back there at that motel in the middle of the nevada desert sitting in on titanian strategy ill be glad to contribute title deeds to both of you pete said to mary anne and dave mutreaux mary you can have san rafael mutreaux you can have san anselmo those will bring you to the table i hope no one spoke no one felt optimistic enough to how do you bluff pete said against telepaths it was a good question it was in fact the question on which everything depended and none of them could answer it they cant alter the values of the cards we draw schilling said to himself because weve got mary anne to exert a contrapressure stabilizing them as we hold them but if we can develop a strategy pete said well need the collective minds of everyone in pretty blue fox among all of us there must be an idea we can use you think so schilling said its got to be pete said harshly chapter 15 at ten oclock that night they met in the group condominium apartment in carmel first came silvanus angst this timefor perhaps the first time in his lifesober and silent but as always carrying a paper bag containing a fifth of whiskey he set it on the sideboard and turned to pete and carol garden who followed him i just cant see letting psis in angst murmured i mean youre talking about something thatll make gameplaying impossible forever bill calumine said drily wait until everyones here his tone to angst was unfriendly i want to meet the two of them he said to pete before i decide the girl and the precog who i understand is on jerome luckmans staff back in new york although now voted out as spinner calumine automatically assumed the position of authority and perhaps it was well he did pete reflected thats right pete murmured absently at the sideboard he looked to see what silvanus angst had brought canadian whiskey this time and very good pete got himself a glass held it under the ice machine thank you sir the ice machine piped pete mixed himself a drink his back to the room as it slowly steadily filled with people their murmuring voices came to him and not just one psi but two yes but the issue involved its patriotic so what gameplaying ends when psis come in it can be with the proviso that they terminate as bindmen as soon as this fracas with thewhatre they called the woo poo non something like that according to the chronicle this evening anyhow the vug firebrands you know the ones we thought we beat you saw that article the homeopape system at the chronicle inferred that its been these woo poo noners whove kept our goddam birthrate down implied pardon you said inferred thats grammatically unsound anyhow my point is without quibbling is that its our duty to let these two psipeople into pretty blue fox that vug detective that eb black told us that it was to our national advantage to you believe him a vug hes a good vug didnt you grasp that point stuart marks tapped pete urgently on the shoulder that was the whole point you were trying to make to us wasnt it i dont know pete said he really didnt now he was wornout let me drink my drink in peace he thought and turned his back once more on the roomful of arguing men and women he wished joe schilling would arrive let them in this once i say its for our own protection were not playing against each other were all on the same side in this playing against the vugbugs and they can read our minds so they automatically win unless we can come up with something new and anything new would have to be derived from the two psipeople right because where else is it going to come from straight ozone we cant play against vugs theyll just laugh at us look they got six of us right here in this room to gang together and kill jerome luckman if they can do that not me i wasnt one of the six but it could have been they just didnt happen to choose you anyhow if you read the article in the homeopape you know the vugs mean business they slaughtered luckman and that detective hawthorne and kidnapped pete garden and then but newspapers exaggerate aw theres no use talking to you jack blau stalked away he appeared beside pete and said when are they getting here these two psipeople pete said any time now coming up slipping her smooth bare arm through his carol said what are you drinking darling canadian whiskey everyones been congratulating me carol said about the baby except of course freya and i think even she would except except she cant stand the idea pete said do you actually think its been the vugsor at least a segment of themwhove been keeping our birthrate down yes pete said so if we win our birthrate might go up he nodded and our cities would have something in them besides a billion rushmore circuits all saying yes sir no sir  carol squeezed his arm pete said and if we dont win there pretty soon wont be any births on our planet at all and the race will die out oh she nodded wanly its a big responsibility freya garden gaines said from behind him to hear you tell it anyhow pete shrugged and joe was on titan too you both were joe and i and laird sharp pete said instantly es quaint frey a said pete said get away im not going to vote to admit the two psipeople freya said i can tell you that now pete youre an idiot mrs gaines laird sharp said he had been standing nearby listening i can tell you that at least anyhow i think youll be outvoted youre fighting against a tradition freya said people dont lightly and easily set aside one hundred years not even to save their species laird sharp asked her no ones seen these gameplaying titans except joe schilling and you freya said even pete doesnt claim to have seen them they exist sharp said quietly and youd better believe it because soon youre going to see them too carrying his glass pete walked through the apartment and outside into the cool california evening air he stood by himself in the semidarkness his drink in his hand waiting he did not know for what for joe schilling and mary anne to arrive perhaps that was it or perhaps it was for something else something even more meaningful to him than that im waiting for the game to begin he said to himself the last game we terrans may ever play he was waiting for the titanian gameplayers to arrive he thought patricia mcclain is dead but in a sense she never really existed what i saw was a simulacrum a fake what i was in love with if thats the proper word  it wasnt there anyhow so how can i really say ive lost it you have to possess it first to lose it anyhow we cant think about that he decided weve got other matters to worry about doctor philipson said that the gameplayers are moderates its an irony that what we ultimately have to defeat is not the fringe of extremists but the great center group itself maybe its just as well were taking on the core of their civilization vugs not like eg philipson but more like eb black the reputable ones the ones who play by the rules thats all we can count on pete realized the fact that these players are lawabiding if they werent if they were like philipson and the mcclains we would not be facing them across a gameboard they would simply kill us as they killed luckman and hawthorne and that would be that a car descended now its headlights flashing it came to rest at the curb behind the other cars and its lights switched off the door opened and shut and a single figure a man came striding toward pete who was this he strained to see not recognizing him hi the man said i dropped by after i read the article in the homeopape it looks interesting here no fnool i say buddyfriend correct who are you pete said the man said coolly you dont recognize me i thought everyone knew who i am awop awop woom may i sit in on your group tonight buddy buddy buddy i know id enjoy it he approached the porch stood now beside pete his movements confident and alert hand extended im nats katz bill calumine said of course you can sit in on our game mr katz its an honor to have you here he waved the members of pretty blue fox into momentary silence this is the worldrenown disc jockey and recording star nats katz whom we all watch on tv hes asked to sit in on our meeting tonight does anybody mind the group was watching uncertain how to react what was it mary anne had said about katz pete thought is nats katz the center erf all thisp he had asked her and she had said yes and at the time it had seemed true pete said wait turning bill calumine said surely theres no valid reason to object to this mans presence here i cant believe youd seriously wait until mary anne gets here pete said let her decide about katz shes not even a part of the group freya gaines said there was silence if he comes in pete said i go out out where calumine said pete said nothing a girl who isnt even part of our group calumine began whats your basis for opposing him sutart marks asked pete is it rational something you are able to express they were all watching him now wondering what his reason was pete said were in a much worse position than any of you realize theres very little chance that we can win against our opponents so stuart marks said whats that have to do i think pete said that katz is on their side after a moment nats katz laughed he was handsome dark with sensuous lips and strong intelligent eyes thats a new one he said ive been accused of just about everything but hardly that awop wooml i was bom in chicago mr garden i assure you im a terran woom woom woom his round animated face radiated a potent cheerfulness katz did not seem offended only surprised what will you see my birth certificate you know buddyfriend garden woom i really am wellknown here and there no fnool if i were a vug it probably would have come to light before now wouldnt you think correct pete sipped his drink his hands he found were shaking have i lost contact with reality he asked himself maybe so maybe i never fully recovered from my binge my temporary psychotic interlude am i the person to judge about katz should i be here at all he wondered maybe this is the end for me he said to himself not for them for me personally at last aloud he said im going out ill be back later turning he set his drink glass down and left the room he descended the porch steps and arrived at his car getting in he slammed the door and sat in silence for a long long time maybe im more of a detriment to the group than an asset at this point he said to himself he lit a cigarette then abruptly dropped it into the disposal chute of the car for all i know nats might even come up with the idea we need he s an imaginative guy someone was standing on the porch calling him the voice drifted to him faintly hey pete whatre you doing come on back inside pete started up the car lets go he ordered it yes mr garden the car moved forward then lifted from the pavement skimmed above the other parked cars beepbeeping then above the rooftops of carmel at last it headed toward the pacific a quarter mile west all i have to do pete thought idly is give it the command to land because in another minute well be over water would the rushmore circuit do that probably where are we he asked it to see if it kiiew over the pacific ocean mr garden what would you do he said if i asked you to set down there was a moment of silence call doctor macy at it hesitated he heard the unit clicking trying different combinations i would set down it decided as instructed it had chosen had he i shouldnt be this depressed he told himself i shouldnt be doing things like this it isnt reasonable but he was for a time he managed to look down at the dark water below and then with a turn of the tiller he steered the car into a wide arc until it was skimming back toward land this way isnt for me pete said to himself not the ocean ill pick up something at the apartment something i can take a bottle or so of phenobarbital maybe or emphytal he flew above carmel going north and presently his car was passing above south san francisco and a few minutes later he was over marin county san rafael lay directly ahead he gave the rushmore circuit the instructions to land at his apartment building settling back he waited here we are sir the car bumped the curb slightly the motor clicked itself off the car dutifully opened its door pete stepped out walked to the building door put his key in the lock and then entered upstairs he reached the door of his and carols apartment the door was unlocked and he opened it and passed on inside the lights were on in the living room a lanky middleaged man sat in the center of the couch legs crossed reading the chronicle you forget the man said tossing the newspaper down that a precog previews every possibility that hes later going to know about and a suicide on your part would be big news dave mutreaux rose to his feet hands in his pockets he seemed completely at ease this would be an especially unfortunate time for you to kill yourself garden why pete demanded mutreaux said quietly because if you dont youre on the verge of finding an answer to the gameproblem the answer to how one bluffs a race of telepaths i cant give it to you only you can think it up but its going to be there not however if youre dead ten minutes from now he nodded in the direction of the bathroom and its medicine cabinet ive done a little rigging along the lines of the alternate future id like to see become actual while ive been here ive disposed of your pills the medicine cabinet is empty pete went at once into the bathroom and looked not even the aspirin remained he saw only bare shelves to the medicine cabinet he said angrily you let him do this its rushmore effect answered cringingly he said it was for your own good mr garden and you know how you are when youre depressed slamming the cabinet door pete walked back into the living room youve got me mutreaux he conceded at least in one respect the way i had in mind you can find some other way of course mutreaux said calmly but emotionally you lean toward suicide by oral means poisons narcotics sedatives hypnotics and so forth he smiled theres a resistance to doing it by any other means for instance by dropping into the pacific pete said can you tell me anything about my solution to the gameplaying problem no mutreaux said i cant thats entirely up to you thanks pete said sardonically ill tell you one thing however a hint one which may cheer you or it may not i cant preview it because you arent going to show your reaction visibly patricia mcclain is not dead pete stared at him mary anne didnt destroy her she set her down somewhere dont ask me where because i dont know but i preview patricias presence in san rafael within the next few hours at her apartment pete could think of nothing to say he continued to stare at the precog see mutreaux said no palpable reaction of any sort perhaps youre ambivalent he added shell only be there a short time then shes going to titan and not by doctor philipsons psionic means but in the more conventional manner by interplan ship shes really on their side isnt she theres no doubt of that oh yes mutreaux said nodding shes really on their side but thats not going to stop you from going is it no pete said and started from the apartment may i come along mutreaux asked why to keep her from killing you pete was silent a moment its really like that is it mutreaux nodded it certainly is and you know it you watched them shoot hawthorne okay pete said come with me he added thanks it was hard to say it they left the apartment building together pete slightly ahead of david mutreaux as they reached the street pete said did you know that nats katz the disc jockey showed up at the conapt in carmel nodding dave mutreaux said yes i met him an hour or so ago and talked to him he looked me up it was the first time i had ever run into him although of course i had heard of him he added its because of him that i crossed over crossed over halting pete turned toward mutreaux who followed after him and found himself incredibly facing a heatneedle with katz mutreaux said calmly the pressure simply was too much on me pete i couldnt effectively resist it nats is extraordinarily powerful he was chosen to be leader of the wa pei nan here on terra for a good reason come on lets continue on our way to patricia mcclains apartment he gestured with the heatneedle after a moment pete said why didnt you just let me kill myself why intervene at all because dave mutreaux said youre coming over to our side pete we can make good use of you the wa pei nan doesnt approve of this gameplaying solution once we manage to penetrate pretty blue fox by means of you we can call the game off from this end he added weve already discussed it with the moderate faction on titan and theyre determined to play they like to play and they feel this controversy between the two cultures ought to be resolved within a legal framework needless to say the wa pei nan does not agree they continued along the dark sidewalk toward the mcclain apartment dave mutreaux slightly behind pete i should have guessed pete said when katz showed up i had an intuition but i didnt act on it they had penetrated the group and directly it seemed through him he wished now that he had managed to find the courage to drop his car into the sea he had been right it would have been better for everyone concerned everyone and everything he believed in when the game begins mutreaux said i will be there and you too pete and we will decline to play and perhaps by that time nats will have managed to persuade others i cant see that far ahead the alternative courses are obscure to me for reasons i cant make out they had almost reached the mcclain apartment now when they opened the door to the apartment they found pat mcclain busy packing two suitcases she hardly paused to acknowledge their presence i picked up your thoughts as you came down the hall she said carrying an armload of clothes to the suitcases from the dresser in the bedroom her face pete saw had a craven cavedin look on it in every way she had collapsed from the disasterous clash with mary anne she worked feverishly to complete her packing as if struggling against an inexorable and yet unclearly seen deadline where are you going pete asked titan yes patricia answered as far away from that girl as i possibly can get she cant hurt me there ill be safe her hands pete saw shook as she tried and failed to close the suitcases help me she said appealing to mutreaux obligingly dave mutreaux closed the suitcases for her before you leave pete said to her let me ask you something how do the titanians play the game being telepaths do you think youre going to care patricia said pausing lifting her head and regarding him bleakly after katz and philipson are through with you i care now he said theyve been playing the game for a long time so evidently theyve found a way to incorporate their faculty or patricia said they hobble it pete i see he said but he did not see hobble it how and to what extent patricia said through drugingestion the effect is similar to what the phenothiazine class does to a terran phenothiazines mutreaux said in big doses thats given to schizophrenics in quantity it becomes an antipsychotic mediation it lessens the schizophrenic delusions patricia said because it obliterates the involuntary telepathic sense it eradicates the paranoiac response to the picking up of subconscios hostilities in others the titanians possess medication which acts along the same lines on them and the rules of the game as they practice it require them to lose their talent or at least to abort it by some extent mureaux glancing at his watch said he should be here any time now patricia surely youre going to wait for him why she said still gathering up articles here and there in the apartment i dont want to stay i just want to get out before something else happens something more that has to do with her well need all three of us to exert sufficient influence on garden here mutreaux pointed out you get nats katz then patricia said im telling you im not going to stay one minute longer than i have to but right now katz is in carmel mutreaux said patiently and we want to have garden thoroughly with us when we go there i cant help patricia said paying no attention to him she could not seem to stop her headlong flight her rushing blindly listen dave honest to god theres only one thing that matters to me i dont want to undergo again what we went through in nevada you were there you know what im talking about and next time she wont spare you because now youre with us i really advise you to get out too let eg philipson handle this since hes immune to her but its your life you have to decide she went on then and mutreaux somberly seated himself with the heatneedle waiting for doctor philipson to show up to himself pete thought hobble it hobble the psionic talents on both sides as patricia said it could be an agreement with them we make use of the phenothiazines they use whatever it is theyre accustomed to so they were cheating when they read my mind and then he thought and theyll cheat again we cant trust them to hobble themselves they seem to feel that their moral obligations end when they encounter us thats right patricia said picking up his thoughts theyre not going to hobble themselves when they play you pete and you cant compel them to because in your own playing you dont recognize such a stipulation you cant show them a legal basis on your side for demanding that we can show them that weve never allowed psionic talents at the board he said but you are now your group is voting that daughter of mine in and dave mutreaux in right she smiled at him crookedly heartlessly her eyes lusterless and black so thats that pete garden too bad at least you made the try bluffing he thought telepaths hobbling through medication that acts as a thalamic suppresser dulls the extrasensory area of the brain it could be dulled to various degrees damped to some extent but not entirely gradations can be obtained depending on the amount of medication ten milligrams of a phenothiazine would dampen it sixty would obliterate it and then he thought his mind careening suppose we didnt look at the cards we drew there would be nothing in our minds for the titanians to read because we wouldnt know what number wed obtained    to mutreaux patricia said hes almost managed it dave he forgets that hes not going to be playing on the terran side that hes going to belong to us by the time he seats himself at the game board she brought out a little overnight bag now hurrying to fill it pete thought if we had mutreaux if we could regain him we could win because i know how finally you know patricia said but how is it going to help you aloud pete said we could dampen his precog faculty to an undetermined degree so that it becomes unpredictable through the use of phenothiazine spansules he realized which act over a period of hours at a variable rate mutreaux himself would not know if he were bluffing or not how ac curate his guess was he would draw a card and without looking at it move our piece if his precog faculty were operating at maximum force at that instant his guess would be accurate it would not be a bluff but if at that instant the medication had a greater rather than a lesser effect on him it would be a bluff and mutreaux himself would not know that could easily be arranged someone else would prepare the phenothiazine spansule fix the rate at which it would release its medication but patricia said softly dave isnt on your side of the gametable pete pete said but im right thats how we could play against the titanian telepaths and win yes patricia said and nodded hes worked it out now has he mutreaux asked her he has she said i feel sorry for you pete because youve got it and its too late in coming your people would have a lot of fun wouldnt they preparing the grains of medication within the spansule using all kinds of complex tables and formulae to work out the rate of release it could be random too if you wanted it that way or at a fixed but so elaborate rate that to mutreaux pete said how can you sit there and know youre betraying us youre not a titanian national youre a terran calmly mutreaux said psychic dynamisms are real pete as real as any other kind of force i foresaw my meeting with nats katz i foresaw what was going to happen but i couldnt prevent it remember i didnt seek him out he found   me why didnt you warn us pete said when you were still on our side of the board you would have killed me mutreaux said i previewed that particular alternative future in several i did tell you and he shrugged i dont blame you what other course would you have my going over to titan determines the outcome of the game our acquiring you proves that he wishes patricia said that you had left the emphytal in his medicine cabinet he wishes he had taken them poor pete always a potential suicide arent you always as far as youre concerned thats the ultimate way out the one solution to everything mutreaux said restlessly doctor philipson should have been here by now are you certain the arrangements were understood could the moderates have sequestered his services legally they hold the doctor philipson would never yield to the cowards in our midst patricia said youre familiar with his attitude her voice was sharp laden with dread and concern but hes not here mutreaux said somethings wrong they looked at each other silently what do you preview patricia demanded nothing mutreaux said his face now was pale why notp if i could preview i could preview period mutreaux said bitingly isnt that obvious i dont know and i wish i did he got to his feet and went over to the window to look out for a moment he had forgotten pete he held the heatneedle slackly squinting to see in the evening darkness that lay outside his back was to pete and pete jumped toward him dave patricia barked dropping her armload of books mutreaux turned and a bolt from the heatneedle zoomed past pete he felt the peripheral effects from it the dehydrating envelope that surrounded the laser beam itself the narrow effective beam that was so useful both in close quarters and at a distance raising his arms pete struck the man with both elbows in the unprotected throat the heatneedle rolled away from both of them across the floor patricia mcclain sobbing scrambled after it why why couldnt you predict this she clutched at the small cylinder frantically his face sickly and dark mutreaux shut his eyes and dwindled into physical collapse pawing at himself inhaling raucously no longer concerned with anything else beyond the massive difficult effort to live im killing you pete patricia mcclain gasped backing away from him holding the heatneedle waveringly pointed at him sweat he saw stood out on her upper lip her mouth quivered violently and tears filled her eyes i can read your mind she said huskily and i know pete i know what youll do if i dont youve got to have dave mutreaux back on your side of the board to win and you cant have him back hes ours throwing himself away from her he tumbled out of the path of the laser snatching at anything his fingers closed over a book and he hurled it the book fluttered open and dropped at patricia mcclains feet harmlessly panting patricia backed away still dave will recover she whispered if you had killed him perhaps it wouldnt matter so much because then you couldnt get him for your side and we wouldnt she broke off swiftly turning her head she listened not breathing the door she said the knob turned patricia raised the heatneedle slowly her arm bent and twisted inch by inch until the muzzle of the heatneedle was pointing at her face she stared down at it unable to take her eyes from it she said please dont okay i gave birth to you please her fingers against her will moved the stud the laser beam flicked on pete looked away when he looked back at last the door of the apartment stood open mary anne framed in the outline of darkness walked in slowly hands deep in the pockets of her long coat her face was expressionless she said to pete dave mutreaux is alive isnt he yes he did not look at the heap which had been patricia mcclain he averted his eyes from it and said we need him so leave him alone mary his heart labored slowly horribly i realize that mary anne said how did you know aboutthis mary anne said after an interval when i got to the condominium apartment in carmel with joe schilling i saw nats and of course i understood i knew that nats was the organizations overall superior he outranked even rothman what did you do there pete said joe schilling his face puffy with tension entered the apartment and went up to mary anne he put his hand on her shoulder but she jerked away going alone over to the corner to stand and watch when she came in schilling said katz was fixing himself a drink she he hesitated mary anne said tonelessly i moved the glass which he held i made it go five inches thats all he washolding it at chest level the glass is inside him schilling said it very simply cut his heart or part of his heart out of his circulatory system there was a good deal of blood because the glass didnt go in all the way he was silent then neither he nor mary anne spoke on the floor dave mutreaux gargling struggled his face blue trying to get air into his lungs he had stopped stroking his throat now and his eyes were open but he did not seem able to see what about him schilling said pete said with patricia dead and nats katz dead and philipson he understood now why doctor philipson had failed to appear he knew you would be here he said to mary anne so he was afraid to leave titan philipson saved himself at their expense i guess so mary anne murmured joe schilling said i can hardly blame him bending down pete said to mutreaux will you be all right mutely dave mutreaux nodded pete said to him you must show up at the gameboard oh our side you know why you know what i intend to do staring at him mutreaux nodded i can manage him mary anne said walking over to watch hes too much afraid of me to do anything more for them arent you she said to mutreaux in the same inert neutral tone and prodded him with her toe mutreaux dully managed to nod be glad youre alive schilling said to him he is mary anne said to pete she said will you do something about my mother please sure pete said he glanced at joe schilling why dont you go downstairs and wait in the car he said to mary anne we ll call eb black we dont need you for a while thank you mary anne said turning she walked slowly out of the apartment pete and joe schilling watched her until she was gone because of her joe schilling said were going to win there at the board pete nodded because of her and because mutreaux was still alive aliveand no longer in a position to act for the titanian authority were lucky joe schilling said someone had left the door of the conapt open she saw katz before he could see her she was standing outside and he couldnt make her out until too late i think he had counted on mutreaux precog faculty forgetting or not understanding that shes a variable as far as that faculty is concerned he was as unprotected by mutreaux talent as if mutreaux had never existed and so are we pete thought to himself that unprotected but he could not bother to worry about that now the game against the titanians lay directly ahead he did not need to be a precog to see that everything else would have to wait joe schilling said i have confidence in her im not concerned about what she might do pete lets hope youre right pete said he bent down beside the body of patricia mcclain this was marys mother he realized and mary anne did this to her and yet we have to depend on mary anne joe is right we have no choice chapter 16 to mutreaux pete garden said this is what you have to face and accept as we play mary anne mcclain will be at the board beside you at all times if we lose mary will kill you mutreaux said woodenly i know it was obvious as soon as pat died that my life now depends on our winning he sat massaging his throat and drinking hot tea and more indirectly so do your lives too thats so joe schilling said it should begin any time mary anne said if i understand them anyhow they should begin to arrive on terra within the next half hour she had seated herself at the far end of the kitchen of the mcclain apartment in the living room the amorphous shape of eb black could be made out through the open door consulting with human members of the west coast police agency at least six people were active in the living room now and more were arriving weve got to start for carmel pete said by vidphone he had arranged with his psychiatrist doctor macy at salt lake city for the phenothiazine spansules to be prepared the spansules would be flown to carmel from one of the pharmaceutical houses in san francisco direct to the condominium apartment to be received by bill calumine acting for the group as he always had how long does it take for the phenothiazine to begin acting joe schilling asked pete once hes taken it into his system it should take effect immediately pete said assuming mutreaux hasnt been taking any up to now and since it acted to blunt his psitalent that was highly unlikely the four of them checked out by eb black left san rafael for carmel in joe schillings illtempered old car petes following directly behind them empty on the trip almost nothing was said mary anne stared blankly out the window dave mutreaux sat slumped inertly occasionally touching his injured throat joe schilling and pete sat together in the front seat this may be the final time we make this trip pete realized they reached carmel reasonably quickly pete parked the car shut off the motor and the creaky rushmore circuit and the four of them got out standing in the dark waiting for them he saw a group of people something about them chilled him there were four of them three men and a woman getting a flashlight from the glove compartment of his own car which had come to a halt at the curb behind max he shone the light on the soundless waiting group after a long pause joe schilling muttered i see thats right dave mutreaux said thats exactly how it will be played i hope for all our sakes you can go on hell pete said shortly we can the four noiseless figures waiting for them were titanian simulacra of themselves a vug peter garden a vug joe schilling a vug dave mutreaux and slightly behind the others a vug mary anne mcclain the last was not as effective not as substantial as the others mary anne was a problem for the titanians even in this regard to the four simulacra pete said and if we lose his counterpart the vug pete garden said in precisely the same tone if and when you lose mr garden your presence is no longer required in the game and i replace you its as simple as that cannibalism joe schilling said gratingly no the vug joe schilling contradicted cannibalism occurs when a member of a species feeds on other members of that species we are not of the same species as you the vug joe schilling smiled and it was the smile familiar from years back to pete garden it was a superb imitation the group upstairs in the apartment pete thought the others of pretty blue fox have simulacra appeared for them too correct the vug peter garden answered so shall we proceed on up the game should begin at once there is no reason for further delay it started toward the stairs knowing the way that was the terrible part the part which sickened pete garden the alacrity of the vug as it ascended the stairs its certitude as if it had made this climb a thousand times before it was already at home here on terra in the midst of their customary lives shuddering he watched the other three simulacra follow equally rapidly and then he and his companions started into reluctant motion above them the door opened the vug peter garden entered the conapt of the gameplaying group pretty blue fox hello it greeted those within the room stuart marksor was it the simulacrum of stuart marks regarded it with horror and then stammered i guess everybodys here now heor itstepped out onto the porch and peered down hi greetings pete garden said laconically they faced one another across the table the titanian simulacra on one side pretty blue fox plus dave mutreaux and mary anne mcclain on the other cigar joe schilling said to pete no thanks pete murmured across from them the vug simulacrum of joe schilling turned to the pete garden beside it and said cigar no thanks the vug pete garden answered pete garden said to bill calumine did the shipment arrive from the san francisco pharmaceutical house weve got to have it before we can begin i hope no one intends to dispute that the vug pete garden said a noteworthy idea you have fastened onto in this erratic crippling of your precogs sensory apparatus you are absolutely correct it will go a great distance toward evening our relative strengths it grinned at the group pretty blue fox up and down the gametable we have no objection to waiting until your medication arrives anything else would be unfair answering it pete garden said i believe youve got to wait we obviously wont begin to play until then so dont make it appear that youre doing us a big favor his voice shook slightly leaning over bill calumine said sorry its already there in the kitchen rising from his chair pete garden went with dave mutreaux into the kitchen of the condominium apartment in the center of the kitchen table with trays of halfmelted ice lemons bottles of mixer glasses and bitters he saw a package wrapped in brown paper sealed with tape just think mutreaux said meditatively as pete unwrapped the package if this doesnt work what happened to patricia and the others in the organization there in nevada will happen to me he seemed relatively calm however i dont sense the ominous disregard of all order and legality in these moderates he said that i do in the wa pei nan with doctor philipson and those like him or rather like it he scrutinized pete as pete took a phenothiazine spansule from the bottle if you know the timephasing of the granules within he said the vugs will be able to i dont pete said shortly as he filled a glass with water at the tap the ethical house making up these spansules was told that the range could vary between instantaneous fullaction to any sequence of partial action to no action whatsoever in addition it was told to make up several spansules one varying from another he added and ive picked a spansule at random physically its identical in appearance to the others he held out the spansule and the glass of water to mutreaux somberly mutreaux swallowed the spansule i will tell you one thing mutreaux said for your own information several years ago as an experiment i tried a phenothiazine derivative it had a colossal effect on my precognative ability he smiled fleetingly at pete as i told you before we went over to pat mcclains this idea of yours is an adequate solution to our problems as nearly as i can foresee congratulations do you say that pete asked as someone genuinely with us or merely as someone forced to play on this side of the table i dont know mutreaux said im in transition pete time will tell turning he walked back into the living room without another word back to the great gameboard and the two opposing parties the vug bill calumine rose to its feet and announced i suggest our side roll first and then your side it took the spinner and spun with expert vigor the pointer stopped at nine all right bill calumine said also rising and facing his simulacrum he too rolled for him the pointer slowed as it came close to twelve then started to pass on toward one to mary anne pete said are you resisting any efforts on their part at psychokinesis yes she said concentrating on the barelymoving pointer the pointer stopped on one its fair mary anne said in a scarcely audible voice you titanians initiate play then pete conceded he managed to suppress his discouragement he kept it out of his voice good his simulacrum said it regarded him grinning mockingly then we will transport the field of interaction from terra to titan it added we trust that you terrans will not object what joe schilling said wait but the transforming activity had begun it was already too late the room trembled and became hazed over and the simulacra seated opposite them had pete thought begun to attain a disrupted oblique quality as if he thought their physical shapes no longer functioned adequately as if like archaic malformed exoskeletons they were now in the process of being discarded his simulacrum seated directly across from him all at once lurched hideously its head lolled and its eyes became glazed empty of light filmed over with a destructive membrane the simulacrum shivered and then up its side a long rent appeared the same process was occurring in the other simulacra the pete garden simulacrum quivered vibrated and then from the headtofoot rent something tentative popped quaveringly out of the rent squeezed the protoplasmic organism within the vug in authentic shape no longer requiring the artificial hull was emerging forcing its way out into the grayyellow light of the weakened sun out of each discarded human husk a vug emerged and the husks teetered and one by one as if blown by an impalpable wind writhed and then danced away weightless already without color bits and flakes of the discarded husks blew in the air particles drifted across the gameboard and pete garden horrified hurriedly brushed them away the titanian gameplayers had appeared in their actual shapes at last the business of the game had begun in earnest the fraud of the simulated terran appearance had been abolished it was no longer needed because the game was no longer being played on earth they were now on titan in as calm a voice as possible pete garden said all our plays will be made by david mutreaux although we will in turn draw the cards and perform the other chores of the game the vugs opposite them seemed to thoughtpropagate a derisive meaningless laughter why pete wondered it was as if once the simulacra shapes had been discarded communication between the two races had at once suffered an impairment joe he said to joe schilling if its all right with bill calumine id like you to move our pieces okay joe schilling said nodding tendrils of gray smoke cold and damp sifted onto the gametable and the vug shapes opposite them dimmed into an irregular obscurity even physically the titanians had retreated as if desiring as little contact with the terrans as possible and it was not out of animosity it seemed to be a spontaneous withdrawal maybe pete thought we were doomed to this encounter from the very start it was the absolutelydetermined outcome of the initial meeting of our two cultures he felt hollow and grim more determined than ever to win the game before them draw a card the vugs declared and their propagations seemed to merge as if there was in actuality only one vug against whom the group played one massive inert organism opposing them ancient and slow in its actions but infinitely determined and wise pete garden hated it and feared it mary anne said aloud they are beginning to exert influence on the deck of cards all right pete said keep your attention as fully formed as you can he himself felt overwhelmingly tired have we lost already he wondered it felt like it it felt as if they had been playing for an endless time now and yet they had barely begun reaching out bill calumine drew a card dont look at it pete warned i understand bill calumine said irritably he slid the card unexamined to dave mutreaux mutreaux in the flickering halflight sat with the card face down before him his face wrinkled with concentration seven squares he said then joe schilling on a signal from calumine moved their piece ahead seven squares the square on which it came to rest read rise in fuel costs pay bill to utility company of 50 raising his head joe schilling faced the titanian authority squatting opposite them on the far side of the board there was no call the titanians had decided to allow the move to pass they did not believe it to consist of a bluff all at once dave mutreaux turned to pete garden and said weve lost that is were going to lose i preview it absolutely its there in every alternative future pete garden stared at him but your ability joe schilling pointed out have you forgotten its now highly impaired a new experience for you youre disoriented isnt that it mutreaux said haltingly but it does not feel impaired the vug authority facing them said do you wish to withdraw from the game  not at this point pete answered and bill calumine white and stricken reflexively nodded in agreement what is this pete asked himself whats going on has dave mutreaux despite the threat from mary anne betrayed us mutreaux said i spoke aloud because they he indicated the vug opponent they can read my mind anyhow that was true pete nodded his mind laboring furiously what can we salvage here he asked himself he tried to control his plunging panic his intuition of defeat joe shilling lighting a cigar leaned back and said i think wed better go on he did not appear worried and yet of course he was but joe schilling pete realized was a great gameplayer he would not show his emotions or capitulate in any way joe would go on to the end and the rest of them would too because they had to it was as simple as that if we win pete said to the vug opponent we obtain control of titan you have as much to lose you have as much at stake as we do the vug drew itself up shivered replied play its your turn to draw a card joe schilling reminded it true admonished the vug now drew a card it paused and then on the board its piece advanced one two three    nine squares in all the square read planetoid rich in archeological treasures discovered by your scouts win 70000 was it a bluff pete garden turned toward joe schilling and now bill calumine leaned over to confer the others of the group too bent closer murmuring joe schilling said id call it up and down the table the members of pretty blue fox hesitantly voted the vote ran in favor of calling the move as a bluff but it was close bluff joe schilling stated aloud the vugs card at once flipped over it was a nine its fair mary anne said in a leaden voice im sorry but it is no psiforce that i could detect was exerted on it the vug said prepare your payment please and again it laughed or seemed to laugh pete could not be certain which in any case it was a violent and quick defeat for pretty blue fox the vuggish side had won 70000 from the bank for having landed on the square and an additional 70000 from the groups funds due to the inaccurate call of bluff 140000 in all dazed pete sat back trying to keep himself composed at least externally for the sake of the others in the group he had to again the vug said i ask your party to concede no no joe schilling said as jack blau shakily counted out the groups funds and passed them over this is a calamity bill calumine stated quietly havent you survived such losses in the game before joe schilling asked him scowling have you calumine retorted yes schilling said but not in the end calumine said in the end schilling you didnt survive in the end you were defeated exactly as youre losing for us now here at this table schilling said nothing but his face was pale lets continue pete said calumine said bitterly it was your idea to bring this jinx here we never would have had this bad luck without him as spinner but youre not our spinner any longer mrs angst spoke up in a low voice play stuart marks snapped another card was drawn passed unread to dave mutreaux he sat with it face down before him and then slowly he moved their piece ahead eleven places the square read pet cat uncovers valuable old stamp album in attic you win 3000 the vug said bluff  dave mutreaux after a pause turned over the card it was an eleven the vug had lost and therefore had to pay it was not a huge sum but it proved something to pete that made him tremble the vug could be wrong too the phenothiazinecrippling was working effectively the group had a chance now the vug drew a card examined it and its piece moved ahead nine spaces error in old tax return assessed by federal government for 80000 the vug shuddered convulsively and a faint barely auddible moan seemed to escape from it this pete knew at once could be a bluff if it was and they did not call it the vuginstead of losing that sumcollected it all it had to do was turn over its card show that it had not drawn a nine the vote of pretty blue fox member by member was taken it was in favor of not calling the move as a bluff we decline to call joe schilling stated reluctantly with agonized slowness the vug paid from its pile of money 80000 to the bank it had not been a bluff and pete gasped with relief the vug had now lost back over half of what it had won on its great previous move it was in no sense whatsoever an infallible player and like pretty blue fox the vug could not conceal its dismay at a major setback it was not human but it was alive and it had goals and desires and anxieties it was mortal pete felt sorry for it youre wasting your affect the vug said tartly to him if you pity me i still hold the edge over you terran for now pete agreed but youre involved in a declining process the process of losing pretty blue fox drew another card which as before was passed to dave mutreaux he sat this time for an interval that seemed forever call it bill calumine blurted at last mutreaux murmured three the terran piece was moved by joe schilling and pete read mud slide endangers house foundations fee to construction firm 14000 the vug did not stir and then suddenly it stated i do not call dave mutreaux glanced at pete he reached out and turned over the card x it was not a three it was a four the group had wonnot lost14000 the vug had failed to call the bluff astonishing the vug said presently that such a handicapping of your ability would actually that you could profit by it it savagely drew a card then shoved its piece ahead seven squares postman injured on your front walk protracted lawsuit settled out of court for the sum of 300000 good god in heaven pete thought it was a sum so staggering that the game certainly hinged on it he scrutinized the vug as everyone else in pretty blue fox was doing trying to discover some indication was it bluffing or was it not if we had one single telepath he thought bitterly if only but they could never have had patricia and hawthorne was dead and had they possessed a telepath the vug authority would undoubtedly have summoned up some system of neutralizing it just as they had neutralized its telepathic factor that was obvious both sides had played the game too long to be snared as simply as that both were prepared if we lose pete said to himself i will kill myself before i let myself fall into the hands of the titanians he reached into his pocket wondering what he had there only a couple of methamphetamines perhaps left over from his luckhinge how long ago had it been one day two it seemed like months ago now another world away methamphetamine hydrochloride  on his binge it had made him temporarily into an involuntary telepath a meager one but to a decisive degree methamphetamine was a thalamic stimulator its effect was precisely the opposite from that of the phenothiazines he thought yes without water he managedgaggingto gulp down the two small pink methamphetamine tablets wait he said hoarsely to the group listen i want to make the decision on this play wait they would wait at least ten minutes he knew for the methamphetamine to take effect the vug said there is cheating on your side one member of your group has ingested drugstimulants at once joe schilling said you previously accepted the phenothiazine class in principle you accepted the use of medication in this game but i am not prepared to deal with a telepathic faculty emanating from your side the vug protested i scanned your group initially and saw none in evidence and no plan to obtain such a faculty joe schilling said that appears to have been an acute error on your part he turned to watch pete all the members of pretty blue fox were watching pete now well joe asked him tensely pete garden sat waiting fists clenched for the drug to take effect five minutes passed no one spoke the only sound was joe schilling drawing on his cigar pete bill calumine said abruptly we cant wait any longer we cant stand the strain thats true joe schilling said his face was wet and florid shiny with perspiration now his cigar had gone out too make your decision even if its the wrong one mary anne said pete the vug is attempting to shift the value of its card then it was a bluff pete said instantly it had to be or the vug would have left the value strictly alone to the vug he said we call your bluff the vug did not stir and then at last it turned over the card the card was a six it had been a bluff pete said it gave itself away and he was shaking wildly the amphetamines didnt help me and the vug can tell that it can read my mind so im happy to say it aloud it turned out to be a bluff on our part on my part i didnt have enough of the amphetamines and there wasnt any alcohol to speak of in my system it was not successfully developing a telepathic faculty in my system i wouldnt have been able to call it but i had no way of knowing that the vug palpitating and a dark slate color now bill by bill paid over the sum of 300000 to pretty blue fox the group was extremely close to winning the game they knew it and the vug opposing them knew it it did not have to be said joe schilling murmured if it hadnt lost its nerve with trembling fingers he managed to relight his cigar it would at least have had a fiftyfifty chance first it got greedy and then it got scared he smiled at the members of the group on both sides of him a bad combination in bluff his voice was low intense it was the combination in me many years ago that helped wipe me out in my final play against bindman lucky luckman the vug said it seemed to me that i have for all intents and purposes lost this game against you terrans you dont intend to continue joe schilling demanded removing his cigar from his lips and scrutinizing the vug he had himself completely under control his face was hard to him the vug said yes i intend to continue everything burst in pete gardens face the board dissolved and he felt dreadful pain and at the same time he knew what had happened the vug had given up and in its agony it intended to destroy them along with it it was continuingbut in another dimension another context entirely and they were here with it on titan on its world not their own their luck had been bad in that respect decisively so chapter 17 mary annes voice reached him coolly and placidly its attempting to manipulate reality pete using the faculty by which it brought us to titan shall i do what i can yes he grated he could not see her he lay in darkness in a darkened pool which was not the presence of matter around him but its absence where are the others he won dered scattered everywhere perhaps over millions of miles of vacant meaningless space andover millenniums there was silence mary he said aloud no answer  mary he shouted in desperation scratching at the darkness are you gone too he listened there was no response and then he heard something or rather felt it in the darkness some living entity was probing in his direction some sensory extension of it a device feeling its way it was aware of him curious about him in a dim limited but shrewd way something even older than the vug against which they had played he thought its something that lives here between the worlds between the layers of reality which make up our experience ours and the vugs get away from me he thought he tried to scamble to move rapidly or at least repel it the creature interested even more now came closer joe schilling he called help me i am joe schilling the creature said and it made its way toward him urgently now unwinding and extending itself greedily greed and fear it said a bad combination the hell youre joe schilling he said in terror he slapped at it twisting trying to roll away but greed alone the thing continued is not so bad its the prime motivating pressure of the selfsystem psychologically speaking pete garden shut his eyes god in heaven he said it was joe schilling what had the vugs done to him what had he and joe become out here in the darkness or had the vugs done this was it instead just showing them this he bent forward found his foot began feverishly to unlace his shoe he took off the shoe and reaching back clouted the thing joe schilling as hard as he could with it hmmm the thing said ill have to mull this over and it withdrew panting he waited for it to return he knew that it would joe schilling floundering in the immense vacuity rolled seemed to fall caught himself choked on the smoke of his cigar and struggled to breathe pete he said loudly he listened there was no direction no up or down no here no sense of what was him and not him no division into the i and the noti silence pete garden he said again and this time he sensed something sensed it but did not actually hear it is that you he demanded yes its me the answer came and it was pete yet it was not whats going on joe said whats the damn thing doing to us its cheating away a mile a minute isnt it but well get back to earth i have faith well find our way back after all we won the game didnt we and we were positive we werent going to be able to do that again he listened pete said come closer no schilling said for some dam reason idont trust you anyhow how can i come closer im just rolling around here right you too come closer the voice repeated monotonously no joe schilling said to himself he did not trust the voice he felt frightened get away he said and paralyzed listened it had not gone away in the darkness freya gaines thought its betrayed us we won and got nothing that bastard organismwe never should have trusted it or put any faith in petes idea of playing it i hate him she said to herself its his and joes fault id kill them both of them she thought furiously id crunch them to death she reached out groping with both hands in the darkness id kill anyone right now i want to kill mary anne mcclain said to pete listen pete its deprived us of all our modes of apprehending reality its iis that its changed im sure of it can you hear me she cocked her head strained to hear there was nothing no answer its atomized us she thought as if were each of us in an extreme psychosis isolated from everyone else and every familiar attribute in our method of perceiving time and space this is frightened hating isolation she realized it must be that what else can it be it cant be real and yet perhaps this is fundamental reality beneath the conscious layers of the psyche maybe this is the way we really are theyre showing us this killing us with the truth about ourselves their telepathic faculty and their ability to mold and reform minds to infuse them she retreated from the thought and then below her she saw something that lived stunted alien creatures warped by enormous forces into miserably malformed distorted shapes crushed down until they were blinded and tiny she peered at them the waning light of a huge dying sun lit and relit the scene and then even as she watched it faded into dark red and at last utter blackness snuffed it out once more faintly luminous like organisms inhabitating a vast depth the stunted creatures continued to live after a fashion but it was not pleasant she recognized them thats us terrans as the vugs see us close to the sun subject to immense gravitational forces she shut her eyes i understand she thought no wonder they want to fight us to them were an old waning race thats had its period that must be compelled to abandon the scene and then the vugs a glowing creature weightless drifted far above beyond the range of the crushing pressures the blunted dying creatures on a little moon far from the great ancient sun you want to show us this she realized this is how reality appears to you and its just as real as our own view butno more so do you grasp that she asked the glowing weightless presence that was the spiraling titanian that our view of the situation is equally true yours cant replace ours or can it is that what you want she waited for the answer her eyes squeezed shut with fear ideally a thought came to her drily both views can be made to coincide however in practicality that does not work opening her eyes she saw a blob a mound of sagging gelatinous protoplasmludicrously with its name stitched to its front in red thread eb black what she demanded and looked around eb black thoughtradiated to her there are difficulties we have not resolved them ourselves hence the contradictions within our culture it added ive prevailed over the gameplayers whom your group was pitted against youre here on terra in your familys apartment in san rafael where i am currently conducting my criminal investigation light and the force of gravity both were acting on her she sat up warily i saw you saw the view which obsesses us we cant repudiate it the vug flowed closer to her anxious to make its thoughts truly clear were aware that its partial that its unfair to you terrans because you have as you say an equal and opposite and as completely binding a view of us in return however we continue to perceive as you just now experienced it added it would have been unfair to leave you in that frame of reference any longer mary anne said we won the game against you our citizens are aware of that we repudiate punitive efforts by our distraught gameplayers logically having won you must be returned to terra anything else is unthinkable except of course to our extremists your gameplayers they will not be punished they are too highlyplaced in our culture be glad youre here be content miss mcclain its tone was harsh i mary anne said and the other members of our group where are they now they were not here in san rafael obviously at carmel scattered eb black said irritably she could not tell if it were angry at her at the members of the group or at its fellow vugs the whole situation appeared to annoy it youll see them again miss mcclain now if i may return to my investigation    it moved toward her and she retreated not wanting to come into bodily contact with it eb black reminded her too much of the other the one against which they had playedplayed and won and then been cheated out of their victory not cheated eb black contradicted your victory has merely beenheld back from you it is still yours and you will obtain it it added in time there was a faint tinge of relish in its tone eb black was not particularly saddened by the plight of pretty blue fox the fact that its members were scattered frightened and confused in chaos may i go to carmel she asked of course you may damn well go anywhere you wish miss mcclain but joe schilling is not in carmel youll have to search elsewhere i will she said ill look until i find him pete garden too until the group is back together again she thought as it was before when we sat across the board from the titanian gameplayers as we were in carmel just a little while ago this evening a little whileand a long way ago turning she left the apartment and did not look back a voice eager and querulous prodded at joe schilling he moved away from ittried to anyhowbut it crept after him um it gibbered uh say mr schilling you got a minute in the darkness he floated closer always closer until it was right on him throttling him he was unable to breathe ill just take a little of your time okay it paused he said nothing well the voice resumed ill tell you what id like as long as youre here visiting us and i mean its really a distinct honor you know schilling said get away from me he pawed at it and it was as if his hands broke through webs sticky mislinked sections of webs and accomplishing nothing the voice bleated uh heres what we both wanted to ask es and i i mean you hardly ever get out to portland right so by any chance do you have that ema berger recording ofwhats it called from die zauberflote you know breathing heavily joe schilling said the queen of the night aria yes thats it greedily the voice crept over him pressing him inexorably it would never turn back now da dumdum dum da deedee dada dum dum another voice a womans joined in both voices clamored at him yes i have it joe schilling said on swiss hmv both of the queen of the night arias back to back can we have them the voices chimed together yes he said light gray and fragmented fluttered before him he managed to get to his feet my record shop in new mexico he asked himself no the voices had said he was in portland oregon what am i doing here he asked himself why did the vug set me down here he looked around he stood in the unfamiliar living room of an old house on bare soft wooden floors facing a mothscavenged old red and white couch on which sat two familiar figures short squat with illcut hair a man and woman leering at him with avidity you dont actually have the record with you by any chance es sibley squawked beside her les sibleys eyes glowed with eagerness he could not sit still and he got to his feet to pace about the barren echoing living room in the corner a phonograph played loudly the cherry duet joe schilling for once in his life wished he could stuff his fingers in his ears could cut out all such sound it was too screechy too blaring it made his head ache and he turned away taking a deep unsteady breath no he said its back at my shop he wished like hell for a cup of hot black coffee or tea for good ooh long tea es sibley said you all right mr schilling he nodded im okay he wondered about the rest of the group had all of them been dispersed dropped like dry leaves to flutter over the plains of earth evidently so the titanian could not quite give up but at least the group was back the game was over schilling said listen he phrased his question carefully word by word ismycaroutside he hoped so prayed so no les sibley said we picked you up and brought you out here to oregon dont you remember beside him es giggled showing her large sturdy teeth he doesnt remember how he got here les said to her and they both laughed now together i want to call max joe schilling said i have to go im sorry he got totteringly to his feet goodbye but the erna berger record es sibley protested dismayed ill mail it he made his way step by step toward the front door he had a vague memoryor senseof its location i have to find a vidphone call max you can call from here les sibley said guiding him toward the hall to the dining room and then maybe you can stay a httle no schilling found the vidphone and snapping it on dialed the number of his car presently maxs voice sounded yeah this is joe schilling come and get me come and get your fatassed self the car said joe schilling gave it the address and then he made his way back down the hall to the living room once more he reseated himself on the chair where he had been sitting and groped reflexively hopefully for a cigar or at least his pipe the music even more than before filled his ears and made him cringe he sat hands clasped together waiting but each minute feeling a little better a little more certain what had happened to them how they had come out standing in the grove of eucalyptus trees pete garden knew where he was the vugs had released him and he was in berkeley in his old original bind which he had lost to walt remington who had turned it over to pendleton associates who had in turn sold it to luckman who now was dead on a roughhewn bench among the trees directly ahead of him sat a silent motionless girl it was his wife he said carol are you all right she nodded thoughtfully yes pete ive been here a long time going over things in my mind you know were very fortunate to have had her on our side that mary anne mcclain i mean yes he agreed he walked up to her hesitated and then seated himself beside her he was glad more so than he could say to see her carol said have you any idea what she could have done to us if she were malevolent ill tell you pete she could have whisked the baby out from inside me do you realize that he had not he was sorry now to even hear about it true he admitted his heart becoming cold with fear again dont be afraid carol said shes not going to do it any more than you go about running people down and killing them with your car after all you could do it and as a bindman you might even get away with it she smiled at him mary anne isnt a danger to either of us in many ways pete shes more sensible than we are more reasonable and mature ive had a lot of time to think this out sitting here it seems like years he patted her on the shoulder then bent and kissed her carol said i hope you can win berkeley back i guess dotty luckman owns it now you should be able to shes not such a good player i guess dotty could spare it pete said shes got all the east coast titles that lucky left her do you think well be able to keep mary anne in the group no he said thats a shame carol looked around her at the huge old eucalyptus grove its nice here in berkeley i can see why you were so unhappy at losing it and luckman didnt really enjoy it for itself he just wanted it as a base for playing and winning she paused pete i wonder if the birthrate will return to normal now since we beat them god help us he said if it doesnt it will carol said i know it will im the first of many women call it a psionic talent precognition on my part but im positive of it whatll we call our child in my opinion it depends on whether its a boy or a girl carol smiled maybe itll be both then he said freya would be right in her schizoid jibe when she said she hoped it was a baby implying she wasnt convinced of it i mean of course one of each twins when was the last pair of twins bom he knew the answer by heart fortytwo years ago in cleveland to a mr and mrs toby perata and we could be the next carol said its not likely but we won carol said softly remember i remember pete garden said and put his arms around his wife stumbling in the darkness over what appeared to be a curb david mutreaux reached the main street of the small kansas country town in which he found himself ahead he saw lights he sighed with relief and hurried what he needed was a car he did not even bother to call his own god knew where it was and how long he would have to wait for its arrival assuming he could contact it instead he strode up the single main street of the town fernley it was calleduntil he came to a homeostatic carrental agency there he rented a car drove it away at once and then parked at the curb and sat by himself getting his courage together to the rushmore effect of the car mutreaux said listen am i a vug or a terran lets see the car said youre a mr david mutreaux of kansas city briskly the rushmore continued you are a terran mr mutreaux does that answer your question thank god mutreaux said yes that answers my question he started up the car then and headed by air toward the west coast and carmel california its safe for me to go back to them he said to himself safe in regards to them safe period because ive thrown off the titanian authority doctor philipson is on titan nats katz was destroyed by the psychokinetic girl mary anne mcclain and the organizationwhich was subverted from the starthas been obliterated i have nothing to fear in fact i helped win i played my part well in the game he previewed his reception there they would be the members of pretty blue fox trickling in one by one from the various points on earth at which the titanians had summarily deposited them the group reformed everyone back together they would open a bottle of jack daniels tennessee whiskey and a bottle of canadian whiskey as he piloted his car toward california he could taste it hear the voices see the members of the group now the celebration of their victory everyone was there or was it everyone almost everyone anyhow that was good enough for him tramping across the sand the wasteland which was the nevada desert freya garden gaines knew that it would be a long time before she got back to the condominium apartment in carmel and anyway she thought to herself what did it matter what did she have to look forward to the thoughts she had had as she floundered in the intermediate regions into which the titanian gameplayers had hurled them  i dont repudiate those thoughts she said to herself with envenomed bitterness pete has his pregnant mare his wife carol hell never notice me again as long as i live in her pocket she found a strip of rabbitpaper getting it out she removed the wrapper and bit it with the light cast by her cigarette lighter she examined it and then crumpled it up and violently flung it away from her nothing she realized and itll always be like this for me its petes fault if he made it with that carol holt creature he could have made it with me god knows we tried it enough times it must have been several thousand evidently he just didnt want to succeed twin lights flashed ahead of her she halted cautiously gasping for breath wondering what she had arrived at a car lowered itself warily to the surface of the desert its signal lights flashing on and off it landed stopped the door opened mrs gaines a cheerful voice called peering freya walked toward the car behind the wheel sat a balding friendlylooking elderly man im glad i found you the elderly man said get in and well drive out of this dreadful desertarea where exactly do you want to go he chuckled carmel no freya said not carmel never again she thought where then what about pocatello idaho why pocatello freya demanded but she got into the car it was better than continuing to wander aimlessly across the desert alone in the darkness with no onecertainly none of the groupto help her to give a damn about what happened to her the elderly man as he started up the car said pleasantly im doctor eg philipson she stared at him she knewshe was positive she knew who he was or rather who it was do you want to get out doctor philipson asked her i could if you wish set you back down there again where i found you nno freya murmured she sat back in her seat scrutinized him thoroughly thinking to herself many thoughts doctor eg philipson said to her mrs gaines how would you like to work for us for a change he glanced her way smiling a smile without warmth or humor a smile utterly cold freya said its an interesting proposal but id have to think it over i couldnt decide just like that right now very interesting indeed she thought youll have time doctor philipson said were patient youll have all the time in the world his eyes twinkled freya smiled back humming confidently to himself doctor philipson drove the car toward idaho skimming across the dark night sky of earth end of book'"
